Fortunately the rucksack, filled with essentials, was still where we'd abandoned it in the airport car park. &nbsp;It was long gone 1AM when we'd woken the warden at <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/sv/upptack/Omraden/Jamtland/Vandrarhem/storlien/">Storlien</a>. We'd got the better end of the deal. She was&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;nicer to look at than us and seemed to take it&nbsp;really&nbsp;well. A long since accepted occupational hazard no doubt.</div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">After a lazy breakfast we'd stocked up on gas and driven the last few&nbsp;kilometers&nbsp;to <a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/upptack/Omraden/Jamtland/Fjallstationer/STF-Storulvan-Fjallstation/">Storulvan</a> through bright sunshine. After two laps of the car park we'd&nbsp;finally&nbsp;found a space, paid for parking and got ourselves kitted up. As we leave the queue for the Fjell express is forming.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As seems to be the way with these things the first 50m of track &nbsp;is steep down. I avoid it by looping off to the right over the bridge but still end up on my ass. &nbsp;My own occupational hazard.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As tradition dictates we had still been uncertain about the route at breakfast. Wed decided, in the last exchange, to stay low today and head out along the relative flat of the river bank towards Tjallingen and &nbsp;to see how far we get. A little practice to find our rythm and get a feel for the area.Given the conditions, not too cold, wind still and sunny, stopping early to make a good camp would seem to be on the cards.</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8570307930/" title="_3089631.JPG by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="_3089631.JPG" height="480" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8570307930_04aaa7cff7_z.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The route is gentle. Just a little up and down. First through the the trees then back to the river and then into the trees once more. Nothing too tricky but tricky enough to see me on my arse once more before lunch. Wrapped in down, sat on my rucksack chewing on a lump of smoked sausage and strapping up my already blistering feet I&nbsp;realise&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;back in the North. &nbsp;I'm smiling broadly when the fast moving older couple kick past and say something in Swedish. Met with blank stares and&nbsp;apologies&nbsp;they tell us to enjoy our meal in broken English. I promise to do my best.</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8570306296/" title="_3089626.JPG by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="_3089626.JPG" height="480" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8570306296_f5376e2721_z.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Only later in the afternoon do the big red crosses of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/">Swedish&nbsp;Touring Association</a> start to make sense. Conditions are still clear but as we gain a little height and move away from the river it begins to feel a little wilder, a little further from the&nbsp;civilized&nbsp;world. &nbsp;I begin to see that under some conditions a handrail might be welcome.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We leave the track in search &nbsp;of a home. We climb a little, through sparse birch and uneven ground, and after a few zig-zags settle for a flat stretch of deep snow. Roughly on the tree line with a grand-stand view of the Southern end of the <a href="http://mapcarta.com/17673894">Bunnersfjallen</a> it looks to be a fine&nbsp;bivouac. I stand and gorp at&nbsp;the&nbsp;scenery for a few moments before turning round and getting on with the busines of setting up camp.</div><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8569247657/" title="_3089684.JPG by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="_3089684.JPG" height="474" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8569247657_8f3b4c16fc_z.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">The boys pitch the tent while I fire up the burner and start the perpetual task of melting snow.&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;running low. Surprisingly low after a relatively gentle day. Cold stacks the odds. When I shove cups of hot soup into welcome hands the shelter is pitched and the dunny is dug. Soup consumed we down up, dig a bench and kitchen and put our feet up.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8569278193/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="_3089719.JPG by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="_3089719.JPG" height="640" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8383/8569278193_8a256973fd_z.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">In front of me lies a massive sheet of white &nbsp;bounded by the bulk of &nbsp;<a href="http://mapcarta.com/17673894">Veastra Bunnerstoeten</a> to the North,&nbsp;<a href="http://mapcarta.com/17683434">Tjallingklumpem</a> to the South and studded with stands of bare, spindly birch. To the uninitiated barren empty wilderness. To my eye full of, albeit subtle, detail and interest. Shadow and light dance cheek to cheek. The low light making relief where none should be; ravines from shallow wind-blown ruts, glistening&nbsp;mountains&nbsp;from sugary lumps. Further off dense blue air hangs in the notch between the high ground to North and South. It occurs to me that through that notch, just a day or so to the east, lies Valadalen. Seperated from the spiritual home of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nordiclightpacking/app_9953271133">Nordic Lightpacking</a> by 30km distance &nbsp;and a <a href="http://thunderinthenight.blogspot.nl/2010/06/planes-trains-soaking-wet-shoes.html">two and a half years in time</a> I watch the sky slowly change colour and reach for my camera.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8569316493/" title="Cold light after Sunset by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="Cold light after Sunset" height="480" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8569316493_6727655aac_z.jpg" width="640" /></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Blue becomes deeper blue, then purple. First imperceptibly purple. Later overwhelmingly in-your-face purple. As I move around shooting photo after photo the sun slowly sinks sucking the last of the day lit air with it as it goes. &nbsp;Going from wind still to decidedly windy inside the count of ten adds another dimension to the evenings dynamic. These things cant be got from behind a layer of glass and brick.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We eat our hot meal after sundown. The others then head off to their bags but I stay a little longer. As long as the cold permits. There's not a lot of this to be had and my share is not very generous. I got my last slice on the thrid day in <a href="http://www.armchair-adventurer.com/2010/02/oyer-fjell-day-3-djupslia-to.html">Oyer</a>. I take a last few photos. These of the tent under a clear milk-strewn sky. just as the cold starts getting the better of my fingers and toes I &nbsp;pack up my camera wondering if Ill wake up dry this time.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davehanlon/8569327005/" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" title="_3089781.JPG by dave hanlon, on Flickr"><img alt="_3089781.JPG" height="640" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8569327005_dec159d04a_z.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
