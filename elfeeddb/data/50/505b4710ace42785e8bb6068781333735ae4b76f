If anyone out there is looking for probably the best touring bike ever built, then this could be it !<br />
A 1990&#039;s Thorn Nomad, Mk1 frame,  Expedition Spec in unused condition for under two grand.!<br />
<br />
At the time I bought mine (which was the basic Mk1 Nomad) the Expedition spec was out of my financial league.<br />
I don&#039;t think I&#039;d get this one past SWMBO somehow.<br />
<br />
I wonder what the history is ? <br />
Who buys a top of the range expedition bike and then sticks it at the back of the garage for twenty years ?...<br />
