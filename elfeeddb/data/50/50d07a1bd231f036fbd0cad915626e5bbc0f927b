Off my wife and mum I managed to get a nice selection of presents but non cycling related...... Got my card off the inlaws today... And included a gift voucher for my first accreditation lesson at Derby velodrome I was like wow...<br />
 It was something I really wanted a go at.... They said if I like it perhaps further lessons could follow for Christmas presents......<br />
<br />
Can&#039;t wait to get it booked......
