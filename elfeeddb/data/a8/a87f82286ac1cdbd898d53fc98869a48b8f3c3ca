<p>I&#039;ve been scratching my head over this one lately! I&#039;ve rebooted to find wicd not connecting, and stating that no wireless networks were available. After some fiddling, I checked `ip link` to find that my interface, which has been the same for at least 1.5-2yrs... was changed! It&#039;s always been wlp62s0 and upon a reboot changed to wlp621s0. I initially thought this was a systemd bug; according to its <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/" rel="nofollow">predictable network interface names</a>:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>We believe it is a good default choice to generalize the scheme pioneered by &quot;biosdevname&quot;. Assigning fixed names based on firmware/topology/location information has the big advantage that the names are fully automatic, fully predictable, that they stay fixed even if hardware is added or removed (i.e. no reenumeration takes place) and that broken hardware can be replaced seamlessly.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>The point is that the network name is supposed to be <em>hardware</em> based to prevent names from changing. My hardware clearly wasn&#039;t changing, so it must be their bug, right? To my surprise, it appears the reported bus/device location has been changing lately! So, I conclude that systemd is naming things correctly based on hardware location, but somehow my system thinks my hardware is changing... here&#039;s 3 instances of a flip-flopping name:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>Feb 19 16:07:12 lilarch kernel: iwlwifi 0000:3d:00.0 wlp61s0: renamed from wlan0
Feb 24 11:20:49 lilarch kernel: iwlwifi 0000:3e:00.0 wlp62s0: renamed from wlan0
Feb 24 15:05:36 lilarch kernel: iwlwifi 0000:3d:00.0 wlp61s0: renamed from wlan0</code></pre></div><p>Note that the location is changing from 0000:3d to 0000:3e. Could someone suggest where I can look to see what&#039;s causing this?</p><p>As a possible culprit, I have three hard drives installed:<br />- one m2.sata running win7 (main drive that came on the computer)<br />- a secondary SSD in the upgrade bay<br />- a third SSD in the DVD slot</p><p>I&#039;ve noticed that when I reboot and press F9 (HP laptop) to get to the boot devices, sometimes the m2.sata doesn&#039;t show up in the list. When I <em>do</em> want to boot to Windows, sometimes it powers up (lights turn on but screen is sort of backlight but blank), I press nothing to get it to pick the default which should be the unlisted m2.sata, then it blips off for a second, turns back on and boots Windows. Other times it auto boots to Arch even though that&#039;s not the default drive...</p><p>Here&#039;s the list of devices:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>$ lspci
