The theme for International Women's day this year is #BeBoldForChange. The event intends to encourage female participation in climbing, proving that it can be enjoyed by everyone. LLC hold regular events at other walls, supporting women achieve their goals, whatever level they're climbing at. In conjunction with #BeBoldForChange the event will bust some of those myths around climbing, promoting an inclusive climbing environment for everyone to enjoy.
