You need an Arctic winter coat when your out and about in Henley on Thames! It is the 'Canada Goose' down parka which will usually set you back around £800+ for a standard parka made in the company’s Toronto factory. It was featured last night on the UK’s BBC ‘Fake Britain’ programme where a company spokesman bemoaned the import of cheap&nbsp; Chinese copies which patently do not bear scrutiny when it comes to the undoubted quality of the genuine item.<br /><br />However, whatever the qualities of this expensive winter coat, there is a dark and bloody element with sadly taints the product, the company, and those who choose to wear one. Unlike the highly popular North Face Macmurdo Parka which uses faux fur and humanly sourced goose down, the Canada Goose range use real Coyote fur. Trapped in gruesome, steel jawed sprung traps which cause immeasurable suffering to the animal before they are dispatched by gun before being stripped of their coat and dumped in a hellish mound of dead animals.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wtJKRiEUKnY/WEaV1bHQoqI/AAAAAAAAFLk/d-VCvgVd5k8JfUQh5vy1MiDIT0xgLIqxgCEw/s1600/canadagoosewolf.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wtJKRiEUKnY/WEaV1bHQoqI/AAAAAAAAFLk/d-VCvgVd5k8JfUQh5vy1MiDIT0xgLIqxgCEw/s320/canadagoosewolf.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">In recent years as the Canada Goose parka has become ever more popular, it has fueled a huge counterfeit trade which not surprisingly- given the price of a real CG parka- sells poorly made fakes through eBay at prices which betray their dubious origins. Made in the land of fake crap- China- many of these shoddy copies use dog fur brutally removed from live animals by boiling them alive in vats to enable the fur to be peeled off easily. It’s a brutal and grim trade that is being driven by fashion and snobbery. Both the original Canada Goose parkas with their coyote fur trimmed hoods and the counterfeit copies using equally barbarically sourced animal fur, have seen the market for their products grow considerably in recent years. Despite this grim production element which shows such a blatant disregard for animal welfare,receiving wide publicity in recent years.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br />As the popularity for Canada Goose Parkas increases, so does the demand for Chinese fakes. However, unlike the goose down used in parkas like the North Face which uses down and feathers as a by product from birds dispatched for food production, not surprisingly, the Chinese are not that fussy about ripping feathers and down from live birds.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FfuZ-J2pEf4/WEaWBXedk2I/AAAAAAAAFLo/MBh3ps0M474kR211Wmo9-pwyUbY7pN9bACEw/s1600/goose.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="270" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FfuZ-J2pEf4/WEaWBXedk2I/AAAAAAAAFLo/MBh3ps0M474kR211Wmo9-pwyUbY7pN9bACEw/s320/goose.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Despite the fact that the wearing of fur coats has become widely regarded as ethically unsound and a fashion no-no for those who consider themselves as animal lovers, remarkably this element of the fur trade is thriving, thanks to the Canada Goose Company and the production of a garment considered to be outdoor apparel.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Those considering buying one of these parkas need to ask themselves. ‘Is any garment- no matter how functional, trendy and qualitative in design and production- worth an animals' suffering?’ Of course it isn’t! Save yourself several hundred pounds and buy alternative parka made by an ethical company like Patagonia or North Face. You know it makes sense!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Links.....</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><a href="http://thefurbearers.com/other-faqs/what-about-canada-goose">Protection of fur bearing animals </a></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.peta.org/action/action-alerts/canada-goose-jackets/">Peta.. </a></span><br /><a href="https://www.thedodo.com/coyotes-die-for-your-canada-goose-jacket-1070243687.html"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.thedodo.com/coyotes-die-for-your-canada-goose-jacket-1070243687.html">The Dodo</a></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ytg9Y5Od_Oo/WEaWxBqcbbI/AAAAAAAAFL0/sAONDr8gw-8-ox_m397fFDnrB6wejfi3ACLcB/s1600/animatedcrowpecking.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ytg9Y5Od_Oo/WEaWxBqcbbI/AAAAAAAAFL0/sAONDr8gw-8-ox_m397fFDnrB6wejfi3ACLcB/s1600/animatedcrowpecking.gif" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></div>
