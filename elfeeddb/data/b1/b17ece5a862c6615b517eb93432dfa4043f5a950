Does anyone have experience of fixing punctures on tubeless ready rims?<br />
<br />
One of my bikes has tubeless ready rims with inner tubes.<br />
<br />
Fixing today&#039;s puncture wasn&#039;t quite straightforward.<br />
<br />
First problem was unseating the bead from the rim.<br />
<br />
Hand pressure wasn&#039;t enough, although I did manage it with my heels.<br />
<br />
Tube in, it was then a matter of reseating the bead by inflating.<br />
<br />
It did reseat, with a couple of satisfying pops.<br />
<br />
Not too hard with a track pump, but it occurred to me it might not be...<br />
