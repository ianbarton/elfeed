<p>The ocularist is trying a different style of conformer. It has a ridge and a curve to catch her lower eyelid. The new conformer has been coming out a little less frequently, but it&#8217;s still every day or so. I try to keep A-&#8216;s hands away from her face, although sometimes she really insists on rubbing and scratching when she&#8217;s sleepy or just waking up. I also took A- to the eyeglasses store to try on pairs. She&#8217;s in between sizes in the Miraflex line, so we&#8217;ll try again in a few months.</p>
<p>I took A- to the JFRC and the OEYC for socialization. She&#8217;s back to being comfortable in those spaces, I think. I also took her to the breastfeeding clinic to check her weight. 7.84kg puts her comfortably over the 15th percentile curve, yay her!</p>
<p>Since A- has been so interested in our forks and spoons, we got her a fork, which she enthusiastically mashes into her saucer and manoeuvres into her mouth. Sometimes she even manages to pick up food with it. We also got her a toothbrush and a hairbrush. She seems to enjoy using the toothbrush after meals. We haven&#8217;t added any baby toothpaste yet &#8211; it&#8217;s more for getting her used to stuff in her mouth. I brush her hair after brushing mine. Sometimes she tries to imitate me, and sometimes she just plays with the brush when it&#8217;s her turn. She&#8217;ll get the hang of it eventually.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been encouraging more physical activity as a way of helping her build up her appetite and take in more nutrients. This usually takes the form of hide-and-seek, which gets her crawling after us at a decent clip. She&#8217;s also been working on fine motor control: stuffing Duplo into various containers (including sleepers and pant cuffs), emptying and filling the toy egg carton, and playing with books. She was a little interested in the crayons brought by the family home visitor, although she doesn&#8217;t seem to deliberately make marks yet. Anyway, since we want to model what to do with them, I&#8217;ve been able to sketch a little – mostly the back of her head while she plays with W-.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been drawing more on my tablet PC, too. This little experiment of drawing a memory in more detail and colour is helping me observe more carefully, and it&#8217;s fun. We&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s worth the additional 10-15 minutes or so.</p>
<p>I did a little bit of consulting &#8211; a couple of SQL queries and a little Node script to analyze a thread. Thought about a bigger project, too, but I&#8217;m not sure I have the brainspace to build something custom for them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on moving more things off Windows so that I can stay in Linux more often. After looking into alternatives to TurboTax for my corporate income tax returns, I decided to convert my QuickBooks records to <a href="http://ledger-cli.org">Ledger</a>. I&#8217;ve been using Ledger for my personal finances for more than a decade, and I like how manageable plain text is, especially with report command lines and commentary in Org Mode. I found a Perl script to <a href="https://github.com/rcaputo/outofit">convert QuickBooks data to Ledger format</a>. After modifying it to deal with Canadian spelling, I converted my data and started reviewing it. So far, so good. My bank balances match up, at least. There are a bunch of other things I want to pay close attention to (year-end entries and so on), but overall, it looks promising.</p>
<p>I also cleared out the tablet I was using as a baby monitor, replacing it with W-&#8216;s old phone. That works just as fine as a baby monitor, and it works out better than the tablet did as a backup device for when my phone&#8217;s battery runs out. The phone is easier to hold and type on, and it&#8217;s less glaring. More writing, yay!</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve been taking care of A- and writing while nursing, W- has totally taken over cooking for dinner, which is awesome. Pad thai, pasta, shepherd&#8217;s pie (with ground lamb, even) &#8211; yum yum yum. Life is good.</p>
