Hi,<br />
<br />
Planning on a student (read - scrimping, saving and scavenging) tour across Europe this summer. Plans were originally to do the Pacific coast, but we all had a look at our bank balances and realised that wasn&#039;t as possible as it first seemed.<br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been in the process of upgrading my own bike for touring, which is an old Schwinn 434. It currently has a standard 52/39 crankset. Ideally this would be upgraded to either a compact double (50/34) or a road triple (50/39/30). <br />
<br />
My question is...<br />
<br />
