<p>It was when I went to find the Skarn&#8217;s the other day and they were still manky from the day before in the wash basket I realised just how much I wear them. Time for a review.</p>

<p>Haglofs put winter pant in the name of the Skarn&#8217;s but it&#8217;s not as simple as that. I&#8217;m doing winter softshell pants for winter 2016/17 on Walkhighlands and there I&#8217;m mostly looking at heavy fabric and a lot of features where the Skarns are a lighter trimmer all round.<br />
The fabric is the familiar own-brand Flexable, a non membrane softshell in a stiffer feeling medium to heavy weight. It&#8217;s still got good stretch though as well with high wind resistance and good water repellancy. The wind has to get strong and cold to feel it to any degree, it&#8217;s a good trade off for better breathability most of the time.<br />
It does breathe well and dry fast, it&#8217;s good for overnighters and pleasant enough to drive home in after a day walk without squelching in the car seat all the way doon the road.<br />
It&#8217;s tough as well, trees, rocks, cutlery, all have been repelled successfully. Fine after repeated washes too.</p>
<p>There are pockets numbering four. Tow hip which are nice and deep, one thogh which is also a decent size and one at the back which is positioned just low enough actually be useful when you&#8217;re wearing a pack. The zip entry to the back pocket has a storm flap and it follows the asymmetric lines on the stitching line which makes it a little easier to use. The pocket bags are a lighter softshell fabric.<br />
However all the zips are a bit sticky when trying to close them if they&#8217;ve opened full, a combination of stretchy fabric and the zip choice I think. Could be a pre-production issue so I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a deal breaker, I am saying try it the shop though.<br />
There&#8217;s a wee integral belt too, works fine and doesn&#8217;t revolve in it&#8217;s tunnel in the wash like so many similar designs seem to. The inner waist has a nice light fleeciness to it.</p>

<p>The fit is &#8220;retro&#8221;. None of your baggy arsed boot cut fashion designer bollocks that have blighted outdoor trouser the past few years here. No, a slimmer cut with a lower leg that tapers in and doesn&#8217;t snag on the scenery and doesn&#8217;t attract mud and crap from a radius of ten feet.<br />
The cut really is excellent, just room enough for longjons underneath with good knee articulation for high stepping (like an Indian brave*) and all day comfort.<br />
The lower legs have a zipped gusset for less technical monenst and for letting your attach the internal gaiters to your boots. These wee gaiters are great, in a lighter fabric but they&#8217;ve stayed in place through snow and bog.<br />
Right there next to the other ankle stuff in the photies there are the kevlar crampon kick patches, which I have not yet kicked. Why? because the Skarn&#8217;s have a slim fit at the ankle. Ha. Plus I don&#8217;t tend to kick myself in the ankle much anyway.<br />
I do have a pair of winter pants with one shredded ankle, so I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m superior at walking in a straight line or anything. Maybe just getting better as I get older. Maybe just slower now I think about it.</p>

<p>In the harshest of days I can feel cold creeping in when I&#8217;ve been exposed or at rest, but the Skarn&#8217;s have been excellent for much of the time. The slightly lighter fabric choice has means I haven&#8217;t missed having leg vents as I don&#8217;t overheat on warmer days. For the same reason I wear them on my ranger rounds of the deer fence in the Kilpatricks where that lower leg is perfect in the mud and open pathless hillside. Also I don&#8217;t look like a lost mountaineer because they&#8217;re kinda plain and understated looking. And a bit like jeans from a distance.</p>
<p>Good pants. Yes please. Check the zips in the shop.</p>
