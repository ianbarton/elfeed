<p>This month&#8217;s review is <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/news/windproof-jackets-review/0014980/">live here</a>. This one was a breeze to do (did you see what I did there?), the fabrics were all good, and some of the fits fitted me very well.<br />
Adidas was a dark horse, Arc&#8217;teryx were, well, no point in writing a review and then giving the game away I suppose.</p>
<p>I did the photies on the Lang Craigs. I&#8217;m sure Walkhighlands readers think the gear shots I do are really just stock press shots rather than ones actually I take, so this month I did it a little differently.<br />
However, as we can see below, I can&#8217;t tell if the timer light is flashing in bright sunlight leading to many shots of me staring glaikitly at the camera.</p>
