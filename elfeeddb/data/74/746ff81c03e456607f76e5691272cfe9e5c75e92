<p>systemd 233 is scheduled to be released next week, and there is only
<a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av233">a handful of small issues left</a>.
As usual there are <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/NEWS">tons of improvements and fixes</a>,
but the most intrusive one probably is another attempt to move from legacy cgroup v1
to a “hybrid” setup where the new unified (cgroup v2) hierarchy is mounted at
<code>/sys/fs/cgroup/unified/</code> and the legacy one stays at <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/</code> as
usual. This should provide an easier path for software like Docker or LXC to
migrate to the unified hiearchy, but even that hybrid mode broke some bits.</p>

<p>While systemd 233 will not make it into Debian stretch or Ubuntu zesty, as both
are in feature freeze, it will soon be available in Debian experimental, and in
the next Ubuntu release after 17.04 gets released. Thus now is another good
time to give this some thorough testing!</p>

<p>To help with this, please give the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/ubuntu/systemd/">PPA with builds from upstream master</a>
a spin. In addition to the usual packages for Ubuntu 16.10 I also uploaded a
build for Ubuntu zesty, and a <a href="https://people.debian.org/~mpitt/tmp/systemd-master-20170225/">build for Debian stretch</a>
(aka testing) which also works on Debian sid. You can use that URL as an apt source:</p>

<pre><code>deb [trusted=yes] https://people.debian.org/~mpitt/tmp/systemd-master-20170225/ /
</code></pre>

<p>These packages pass our autopkgtests and I tested them manually too. LXC and
LXD work fine, docker.io/runc <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/1266">needs a fix</a>
which I <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/runc/1.0.0~rc2-0ubuntu3">uploaded to Ubuntu zesty</a>.
(It’s not yet available in Debian, sorry.)</p>

<p>Please file reports about regressions <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues">on GitHub</a>,
but please also le me know about successes on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MartinPitti">my Google+ page</a>
so that we can get some idea about how many people tested this.</p>

<p>Thank you, and happy booting!</p>
