The above photo has been nominated by a <a href="http://www.jonathanandrewphotography.com/">nice man</a> for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oppad/sets/72157626702646048/">Oppad Readers Photo of The Year competition</a>. Some nice things were said about it to. Later in the year Oppad readers will vote. This, and 53 others, will be in the running. It's funny, I entered a handful of photo's in each of three categories: Landscape, Outdoor and Culture. At first I intended to enter only one in each but impulse got the better of me. I'm now glad I did. This Oyer landscape wouldn't have made my final selection. That brings a smile to my face now. I guess&nbsp;a core skill of&nbsp;&nbsp;the professional is understanding what appeals to others. Even if I wanted to I couldn't make a living out of photography since the former is clearly not a skill I posses.&nbsp; That and the fact that I'm not good enough: chance plays too big a role in my photography. This is only my second published image.&nbsp;Both have been taken in Norway. To my eye Norway looks good through the lens. Apparently it looks good to others to.</div>
