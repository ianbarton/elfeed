<p>It&#039;s been a while but I found a solution.</p><p>In /etc/pam.d/su, I uncommented the line &quot;auth sufficient pam_wheel.so trust use_uid&quot; and it works. The gui and direct tty login for ad users didn&#039;t work before I uncommented this line and I&#039;m not sure why it would make a difference in this case. To me, this should make only su work properly. If any pam guy can fill me I&#039;d highly appreciate it.</p>
