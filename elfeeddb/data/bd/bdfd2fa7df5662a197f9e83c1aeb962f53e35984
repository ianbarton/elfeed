This one's in the category that I thought I had a chance in; Outdoor. This time it's an image I like myself. Perhaps that's just because I was there? After all I can still smell the woodsmoke and pancakes. The nice judge said some nice things and chose the image even though the pancake is not in view (I promise to try better next time!). Randulf is now officially "stoer" in Holland to!</div>
