Ok<br />
<br />
Tentatively posting this to gauge numbers.<br />
<br />
The Bromley massive is dented and so there will be fewer attendees from down there in the dark depths of Bromley, Kent and beyond (probably a good thing as they&#039;re a bit strange and all that mileage!!) so it will be a homage to the massive this sunday.<br />
<br />
I have no idea of a route-don&#039;t have a fancy new toy to plot it on that might then take me down a mouseketeer route and it depends where people are coming from.<br />
<br />
So howzabouit? Fancy a morning...<br />
