Established in 1977 by Nick Brown, the first Nikwax commercial product, Waterproofing Wax for Leather, was produced in his North London flat.  Forty years later, Nikwax adheres to a strong set of environmental ethics and leads the outdoor gear aftercare sector with its high performance line of PFC-free and water-based waterproofing systems.  At this year's ISPO trade show, Nick Brown outlined how Nikwax's 'more than' philosophy and dedication to innovation has led to Nikwax being the "first and only" with numerous, key outdoor industry innovations.
