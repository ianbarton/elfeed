<p>This site used Cloudflare, because <span class="caps">SSL</span> is hard and my host wanted to charge me money for a certificate. However, that host, <a href="https://www.tsohost.com/knowledge-base/article/1028/install-let-s-encrypt-on-the-cloud">TSOHost, have now integrated Let’s Encrypt</a>, and you can turn it on with two clicks. So, especially given the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39077611">recent Cloudflare bug</a>… I did. Hooray. <span class="caps">SSL</span> for me, being done by my host. Now I’ll never have to go to Cloudflare and purge the cache ever again. Good work TSOHost.</p>
