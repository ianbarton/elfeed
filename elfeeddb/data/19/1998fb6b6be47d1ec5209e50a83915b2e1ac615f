If you lost a Lezyne light in RP this weekend, <a href="https://www.cyclechat.net/conversations/add?to=jefmcg" class="internalLink">message me</a> with a link to the model you lost, and rough time, date and location within the park where you think you lost it.  It was lying on the road, but hadn&#039;t been run over yet, so it hadn&#039;t been there long.<br />
<br />
If the owner is identified, they can have it back, otherwise I have a  nice backup light <img src="/styles/default/xenforo/smilies/smile.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":smile:" title="Smile    :smile:" />
