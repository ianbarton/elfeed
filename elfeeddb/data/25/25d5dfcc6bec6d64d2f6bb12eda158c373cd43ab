It seems like everyone, from regular people to celebs, who tattoos their beloved ones name on them, or a symbol of their love for them ends up breaking up. I'll just name some examples: Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee; Eva Longoria and Tony Parker; Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton; Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder; Rihanna and Chris Brown; Hulk Hogan and Linda Hogan; Kenyon Martin and Trina; and last but not least Amy Winehouse, Miley Cyrus, Brandy, and Halle Berry ALL had tattoos for their lovers which were ultimately covered up instead of completely removed. The wrestler The Undertaker had his ex-wife's name removed from his throat. There are <i>some</i> who last the tide, but still face infidelity rumors: Victoria and David Beckham, Beyonce and Jay-Z, Khloe and Lamar Odom, and Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey. I think if someone loves another person, it really isn't necessary to prove it by inking yourself with their name, initials, lips, etc. But I guess to each his own; whatever floats your boat. I believe that it's bad luck though. Would you consider tattooing your significant others name on your body??? Take a look at the slideshow above to see some of their ink.</div>
