Was talking to a mate yesterday and mentioned that I had been cycling on an A road. His response was, &quot;You cycled on an A road! Don&#039;t you know that&#039;s illegal? You could have been arrested for that!&quot; After proving to him it wasn&#039;t he replied, &quot;Well you shouldn&#039;t have, it&#039;s dangerous!&quot; Granted, that particular A road isn&#039;t one I would choose to cycle again.  Also haven&#039;t decided whether I like the thrill of cars doing close passes at 50 mph.
