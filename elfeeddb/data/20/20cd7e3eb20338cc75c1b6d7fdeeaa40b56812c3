Disraeli.</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>&nbsp;</b><br />I  believe this autobiography illustrates that mountain adventures do not  have to be all cutting-edge or at extreme standards to make for  fascinating reading, for by his admission the author has never been at  that level, although some of the ski mountaineering and exploration  described besides the classic climbing is by British historical  experience of that description. The breadth of experience contained  within this book, over a period of sixty years is however truly  impressive, with many classic climbs and ski expeditions in so many  countries that it will I am sure be a convenient reference point for  future travellers.<br /><br />Harding’s interest in mountains started in his  youth, walking over the hills of South Wales, and his entrance into the  ambit of climbing was when he joined the Cambridge University  Mountaineering Club and took part in an expedition to the mountains of  Iran in 1956. Their explorations and ascents were mainly in the Elburz  range, but this was a typical student outing of that era, driving  overland in two old ex-US Army jeeps, that needed constant attention and  repair, with exposure to all the problems that such a first trip  demand’s of its participants. Personal relationships and argument,  culture shock, and health problems; throughout the book the author seems  to suffer from the ‘squitters’ on innumerable occasions. This outing  obviously had a major influence on the writer, and sowed the seed for a  future adventurous lifestyle.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w_22MWVqEYA/WIsWjFGMZBI/AAAAAAAAFbk/Jg1rXkcTyTsiIr70pSzY2fY61ox5kzH9QCLcB/s1600/B1.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1961.%2BNorth%2BFace%2Bof%2BNelion%2Band%2BBatian%2Bfrom%2Bnear%2BSendeyo.%2B%2528958x1280%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-w_22MWVqEYA/WIsWjFGMZBI/AAAAAAAAFbk/Jg1rXkcTyTsiIr70pSzY2fY61ox5kzH9QCLcB/s200/B1.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1961.%2BNorth%2BFace%2Bof%2BNelion%2Band%2BBatian%2Bfrom%2Bnear%2BSendeyo.%2B%2528958x1280%2529.jpg" width="149" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Although he was ‘privileged’ by  the standards of that era (privately educated, Oxbridge and National  Service in the Welsh Guards), he was not so well heeled that money was  not a real problem for him, and much of his early climbing in the UK was  accessed by hitch-hiking, something rarely undertaken by today’s young  tyros? Including to North Wales and to Skye where a standout achievement  for that period was a traverse of the main ridge.<br /><br />Life then  intruded and leaving Cambridge, having read economics and law he  eschewed following such a career track, and initially joined a City  advertising firm, but somehow he found this was not for him, and so keen  to get travelling again he joined the colonial service, partly enticed  by the long leaves but fetched up in Aden as an administrator and  political officer; whilst exploring the rocks and mountains of the  Protectorate. However on his long breaks he was away to Mount Kenya, and  the Ruwenzori, where he managed some classic ascents, and suffered some  epic outings, with on occasion scratch parties, met on short  acquaintance. I understand a little of these problems for when I lived  in that country often finding a climbing partner was like looking for  rare gems! On other leaves back in the UK he took up a long term  ambition to begin Alpine ski mountaineering, and also to start what  would become over the years many journeys, ascents and tours in the  mountains of Turkey. On one of the ski tours his party was caught in an  avalanche, a great danger for all such groups, and though the rest  survived a family member died.<br /><br />Leaving the Colonial Service he  had to get down to starting a new career, and though initially he had no  wish or inclination for this he decided to take up an offer of a post  as&nbsp; a trainee lawyer (having read such at University), and he also  married. Unlike some of his contemporaries this did not end his mountain  career and he enjoyed some classic alpine ascents and dolomite rock  climbs, but more and more he was into ski touring taking on such classic  outings as the High Level Route, the Valais to Mont Blanc.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Rf0Vpjc-fk/WIsWkMqVUEI/AAAAAAAAFbo/nKyP3ky9pQAOlZ-pIXLPRoY0jRF79WR8gCEw/s1600/B3.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1961.%2BCamp%2Bat%2BHook%25C3%2594%25C3%2587%25C3%2596s%2BFarm.%2BTony%2BGarman%252C%2BRuth%2BDrake%252C%2BMick%2BFearn.%2B%25281280x838%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="130" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7Rf0Vpjc-fk/WIsWkMqVUEI/AAAAAAAAFbo/nKyP3ky9pQAOlZ-pIXLPRoY0jRF79WR8gCEw/s200/B3.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1961.%2BCamp%2Bat%2BHook%25C3%2594%25C3%2587%25C3%2596s%2BFarm.%2BTony%2BGarman%252C%2BRuth%2BDrake%252C%2BMick%2BFearn.%2B%25281280x838%2529.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">But  then having finally finished the marathon of completing his legal  articles in 1969, he took off with his wife and two young daughters as  £10 poms, to Australia. This was for somebody of his background (British  establishment) a very bold and enterprising undertaking, especially as  he had no gainful employment ready on offer in that new homeland. But  somehow things worked out, initially they were in Perth and met up with  some old climbing friends there and he climbed on the local outcrops and  cliffs and even went caving, but then moved to a legal position in  Canberra. Besides much bush whacking and some climbing in OZ and  Tasmania, he managed to visit New Zealand and ascended Mount Cook and on  a later visit other peaks in the South Island.<br /><br />But somehow the  lure of the UK was too great despite a demanding new environment and  lifestyle, and he and his family returned back to the smoke and a job in  the City, as a legal eagle. A real pull of this book is the honesty of  the author about the twists and turns in his life, and his family  relations whilst following his mountain star. Over the next years, trip  followed trip, to Greece, to Turkey again and again, to the Arctic, and  to Spain, an outstanding achievement being a winter ski traverse of the  Pyrenees. I have climbed in that range in the spring (Mont Perdu) and so  a complete crossing of the region was I understand a massive  achievement, and the author thought his party was making a first such,  but was to be sorrowfully disavowed when he found out that this was not  so, for they had been beaten to this by a French team.<br /><br />John  Harding has become a senior figure in the British mountaineering and  skiing world, a former Vice President of the Alpine Club, and a  President of both the Eagle and the Alpine Ski Club. Putting back into  the sports he has so keenly graced his legal expertise, and wise  counsel. In later life he took on with his wife and friends some arduous  treks in Sikkim, Bhutan and the Pamir/Tien Shan region. He is what Ken  Wilson referred to as a ‘crink’; which was never intended as a  derogatory term, it was kindly meant, and was aimed at a member of the  establishment who does good things for the climbing world!<br /><br />A  strength of this book is the amount of background history and story  about the places that the author has visited, with a classic school  education he can elucidate on Xenophon, Hannibal and Odysseus and how  they fit into his mountain explorations. Inevitably coming from the  establishment background he does, his mountain companions were mainly  from his own milieu, but I was surprised how many of them were also well  known to me: unfortunately several of them are now dead.<br /><br />This is  a very well produced book; it has hard covers (case bound) and contains  over 300 pages, and one hundred photographs and maps. These latter  really do place the reader within the mountains, places and ascents  recounted and they are very well executed. I think this book will become  a classic of its genre, a life story packed with interest, adventure  and history.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Sv3-2mIRQo/WIsWiIP9wWI/AAAAAAAAFbw/Ud-cpDbc2oIfQA0PBEuE19MaearUhTfDACEw/s1600/B4.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1981.%2BSendeyo%2B%2526%2BTereri.%2B%25281280x851%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Sv3-2mIRQo/WIsWiIP9wWI/AAAAAAAAFbw/Ud-cpDbc2oIfQA0PBEuE19MaearUhTfDACEw/s400/B4.%2BMount%2BKenya%2B1981.%2BSendeyo%2B%2526%2BTereri.%2B%25281280x851%2529.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">A sole criticism is that I would have wished at the  end of the book an ‘Envoi’. For at the finish of such a world tour, and a  lifetime of travel and adventure, what is the wisdom and meaning which  might be found in such an odyssey? But otherwise a most enjoyable read,  from an author whose honesty and historical/geographical knowledge is  impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Dennis Gray: 2017</b></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Distant Snows – A Mountaineer’s Odyssey <br />John Harding.&nbsp; Published, by Baton Wicks £20</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XGM1ig8C9fA/WIsWYCk_aUI/AAAAAAAAFbc/OjbX-LcULWs4uhFbslqIO6EuCYRBEaOSACLcB/s1600/crow5.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XGM1ig8C9fA/WIsWYCk_aUI/AAAAAAAAFbc/OjbX-LcULWs4uhFbslqIO6EuCYRBEaOSACLcB/s1600/crow5.png" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></div>
