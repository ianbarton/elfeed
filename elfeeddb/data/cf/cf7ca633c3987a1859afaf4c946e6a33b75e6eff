<p>@STiAT</p><p>Oh, great news, thanks a lot for sharing that <img src="https://bbs.archlinux.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /><br />The version of Chromium currently deployed in the Ubuntu repos is 37.0.2062.120. The one in Archlinux repos is still 56.0.2924.87-1, so I guess we just have to wait for a new version to be deployed...<br />Thanks for letting us know and sharing what you know! <img src="https://bbs.archlinux.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p>
