<div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: justify;">If you have a passion for fashion, why not consider a career in fashion design? Fashion design is a great career for anyone obsessed with fashion. Even if you’re not, the career is always very exciting and rewarding, and chances are you’ll meet some highly respected people in the industry.</div><br /><a href="http://thebestworldfashion.blogspot.com/"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_GC5fcQ8yBQk/TTGjl1BFDYI/AAAAAAAAJe4/Dj22O6oN90o/s400/Fashion+Designer+Salary.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">There’s more to fashion design than you could imagine.  You could be a supervisor or a boss of a company, even if you don’t design the clothes. Some aspects of fashion design are more stressful than others. This especially pertains to having your own business. It takes a lot to make your own brand – especially because you’ll be living the poor life for quite some time before you potentially hit a goldmine.  And don’t forget that fashion isn’t limited to clothes, you can also design jewelry like earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.<br /><br />Before you can begin a career in fashion design, you need to have some sort of a background. Whether you go to a fashion school, work in the fashion field for a while, or start your own business, you need to know the basics of being a successful fashion designer.<br /><br />It helps to have a good name or history behind you. One way to achieve this is to go to school. Fashion school is a more focused curriculum. Often, you don’t need a four year degree. An associate’s degree in Fine Arts will sometimes be all you need to get your feet wet. Although most colleges offer a Fine Arts program, it’s best to apply to a fashion school. Try to get into a school that has a good reputation. Although competition to get into these schools can be hard, it’s definitely worth it. It helps to have a background in sewing and drawing, too. During school, you’ll make a (hopefully) impressive portfolio to show perspective employers your talent. Be versatile and passionate. If you always stick to one design, employers won’t see much potential in you.<br /><br />Of course, if school’s not for you, try to get a job working as an intern at your favorite company. Or, just work your way up from working as a receptionist for a random fashion company. Eventually, you’ll be promoted to a seamstress position then to a designer position. It also really helps to have connections. Be friendly to everyone you work with and they might put it a good word for you.<br /><br />If you’re planning on going in your own business, be sure to have a background in business management and marketing. Sell your products to friends and family then start marketing to other designers. Being creative won’t get you far unless you know the business behind fashion design. Many famous designers, like Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren, got their name out just by selling products locally.</div></div>
