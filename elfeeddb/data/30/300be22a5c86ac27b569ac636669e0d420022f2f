I nipped out on my bike to the local supermarket last night(it was pouring down), It&#039;s only a mile there and back. I know pads break down more in the wet, so i expected a fair bit of the black stuff on the rims and forks. I left the bike to drip dry. On checking on it, i was surprised to see the size of pool of black water. My question is, if i leave the black stuff to dry on does it do any harm? I know i&#039;ve been riding for years and should know about these things,but i&#039;ve often wondered...<br />
