out the miles in pools of light beneath a yellow supermoon shining
through thin cloud.</p><p>I’ve always been wary
of cycling in darkness, but night-time commutes have eased my fears
and I now find it an almost meditational exercise. Avoiding the main
roads, I dive off down largely traffic-free rural lanes, lit up like
a Christmas tree with multiple blinking LEDs, hi-vis vest and
armbands. If some car driving maniac takes me out, he at least won’t
have the excuse “I didn’t see him, your Honour.”<br/></p><p>Knocking out 70km in
sunshine this morning, I returned home early to look at an
intermittent creaking/cracking noise that was bothering me from the
rear end of the bike. A few more creak-free miles in darkness,
getting me towards the 100km mark, suggest the culprit was loose
dropout grub screws. Or maybe a dry seatpost. I’d done both just to
be on the safe side…<br/></p><p>The main light I’m
using is a £35 Chinese 900 lumen jobbie. It’s better than the Petzl
headtorch I had been using, but not the quantum leap I’d been hoping
for. While fine for road riding, the clamp design and level of
illumination aren’t sufficient for mountain biking. At this time of
year, I just can’t get the miles in without riding between dusk and
dawn, so I’m slowly inching myself towards spending the serious cash
required for serious lights. Looks like more money for Mr Hope, then.<br/></p>
