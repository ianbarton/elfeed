<p>TeXLive packages have been updated to the 2016 version.</p>
<p>The most notable change is that the <code>biber</code> utility is now provided as a separate package. You can install it normally using <code>pacman</code>.</p>
<p>Pacman hooks are now used in the TeXLive packages so the update will be less verbose than in past years.</p>
