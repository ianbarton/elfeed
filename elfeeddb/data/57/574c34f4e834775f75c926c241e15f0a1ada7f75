<h3>emacs, real auto save, and auto save when you call M-x</h3>

<p>there&apos;s a package called real-auto-save, on melpa. It does “real” save periodically.</p>

<p>i was temped to write my own, but my current solution is that
in
<a href='../misc/ergoemacs_vi_mode.html'>Emacs: Xah Fly Keys</a>
, a modal key mode, everytime i switch to command mode, it also does a save.</p>

<p>you could do the same. For example, everytimes you call M-x, it does a save then M-x. Just write a short elisp command wrapper like “save-buffer-then-execute-extended-command”. If you want and don&apos;t know how, ask, many or i can show you how.</p>
