<p>A couple of weeks ago I mused that I should really collect together the <a href="https://github.com/stsquad/my-emacs-stuff/blob/master/my-git.el#L139">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/stsquad/my-emacs-stuff/blob/master/my-email.el#L562">hacks</a> to integrate checkpatch into my workflow into a consistent mode. Having a quick look around I couldnâ€™t find any other implementations and went to create the said mode. It turns out Iâ€™d created the directory and done the initial commit 3 years ago. Anyway I polished it up a bit and you can now get it <a href="https://github.com/stsquad/checkpatch-mode">here</a>. I hope itâ€™s useful to the wider community and as ever patches welcome <img alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
