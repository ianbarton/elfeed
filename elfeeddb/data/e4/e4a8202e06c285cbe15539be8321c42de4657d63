Now that President Batshit Crazy is in the White House my plan for a cycling holiday in the USA is on hold. <br />
<br />
I&#039;ve been looking at alternatives and I&#039;ve got quite an interest in Persian history and culture.  So the plan is forming for a three centre holiday to Iran - flying out to Tehran, spending a few days there before moving on to Esfahan for a few days and then to Shiraz.  The plan is to take Boudicca for use in and around the cities, and to take the trains for the longer distance...<br />
