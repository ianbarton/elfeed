Just read a post in the travelogue section about a micro tour around the West Country. I&#039;ve got 4 or 5 days available in a few weeks and so thought I!d do the same as it&#039;s been a good few years since I&#039;ve done a multiday bike tour.<br />
<br />
Thought I&#039;d start in Taunton heading towards Minehead. Anyway, doing some rough cost calculations and have been left somewhat shell shocked at the costs. Some ball park costs are £80 for the train from London and about £50 a night for a B&amp;B even after asking...<br />
