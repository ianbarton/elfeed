<p>W- is thinking of shifting his discretionary time for side projects to early morning, before he heads out to work. That way, he can tackle it with more energy and enjoy making steady progress. I&#8217;ve been planning for my discretionary time in the evening, after A- goes to bed. It might be nice to experiment with setting an early alarm and staying in sync with W-. I&#8217;ve tried one-offs here and there and A- generally ended up waking along with me, so I didn&#8217;t get time for other things. If I do it consistently, though, she&#8217;ll probably shift her bedtime earlier.</p>
<p>The main thing that gets shifted around on my end is the journal, since that&#8217;s natural to do at the end of the day. The quick notes I take on my phone will probably be enough, though. Alternatively, I could split it up: sleep after my journal, and then wake up and so other things.</p>
<p>So, how can I ease into this? If I prioritize sleeping during her naps for a couple of days, that should make it easier to wake up early. A- will adjust her own naps based on her energy. This is a good time to try it, anyway &#8211; no major appointments coming up, so we can adjust as needed. I think W- wanted to start being up by 5 or even earlier. Bonus: electricity is cheaper.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see if A-&#8216;s okay with my slipping away early in the morning. If not, maybe I&#8217;ll find my discretionary time somewhere else in the day. No worries! I&#8217;d like at least enough time for my journal and for Emacs News, so that&#8217;s about half an hour to an hour. Interruptible and can be deferred a day or two, so the time is pretty easy to find. Most of the other things can wait if need. The next big chunk is probably filing our personal taxes some time in March or April, but I should be able to find enough focused time in that period. Who knows, maybe A-&#8216;s sleep patterns will have changed by then. We&#8217;ll see!</p>
