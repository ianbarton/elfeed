I would like to replace my old bike computer with a new GPS battery operated one. It has to be AA or AAA battery operated, not a USB rechargeable one with limited (12 or 15 hour) operation time. I need one that will give me distance travelled, anything else is a bonus. I looked at Garmin Oregon range which looked good, is there any thing else? <br />
