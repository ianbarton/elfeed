<p>see what the current leader jwiegley has to say, in comment above.</p>

<p>This decision wasn&apos;t something “I approved of”, in the sense you&apos;re thinking. I do use a Mac, and I do miss my color emojis.</p>

<p>GNU Emacs is a project of the Free Software Foundation, and when they deem an issue as relating to their political agenda, it trumps the technical purview of the project maintainer. I keep Emacs going from a software point of view; they keep the FSF going as a movement.</p>

<p>If RMS says that such a change relates to freedom, I can either acquiesce or walk away. I didn&apos;t think color emojis were important enough to walk away. The gcc/clang dispute was part of the reason the last maintainer walked away.</p>

<p>It&apos;s a free project. If a group of people is willing to put in the effort, you could fork Emacs and make it into something better, freed from the FSF&apos;s policies. Until that happens, expecting them to change by writing blog posts, or commenting on Reddit, is not going to have any effect whatsoever.</p>

<p>by the way, it has always been like that. Every few years, major things like this happen got into news.</p>
