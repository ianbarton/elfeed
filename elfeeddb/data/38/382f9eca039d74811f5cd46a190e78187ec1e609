If what you use for securing and alarming your cycle, causes either injury or upset to someone trying to remove it. Should you be blamed?<br />

&quot;Brown trouser&quot; moment, no injury, when the alarm was set off. Kranks Alarm in use at home. He wasn&#039;t expecting an alarm to be in use.<br />

This caused him to get his arm jammed slightly in the frame. Chain runs through both parts, then into a ground anchor.<br />

I&#039;m assuming he was trying to work out where the chain ran, when he set the alarm off.
