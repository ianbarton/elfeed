It will be a short-lived affair I suppose but sooner short-lived than not at all. Today, a half hour exposed to a fresh wind and -6 on a beach bathed in that wonderful long golden light that so typifies this time of year was a good reminder of what it's all about. How can you appreciate warmth if you've never felt cold? Would long summer days be half so pleasant were it not for long winter nights? Can a person really appreciate luxury without having first a taste of austerity? Time, methinks, to recalibrate. Time for a winter trip! Now, just as the winter Queen stretches her icy finger Southwards for the first time this year, I'm packing my bag to ride North on her coat tails. Troms here I come!</div>
