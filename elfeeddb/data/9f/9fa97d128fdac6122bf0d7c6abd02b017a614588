<p>I need music to be more productive.  Sitting in an open workspace it helps to shut off outside noice too.  And often enough I just turn <a href="http://packages.debian.org/cmus">cmus</a> into shuffle mode and let it play what comes along.  Yesterday I just stumbled upon a singer again that I fell in love with her voice a long time ago.  This is about <a href="http://www.anouk.com/">Anouk</a>.</p>

<p>The song was on a compilation series that I followed because it so easily brought great groups to my attention in a genre that I simply love.  It was called "Crossing All Over!" and featured several groups that I digged further into and still love to listen to.</p>

<p>Anyway, don't want to delay the songs for you any longer, so here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RaHTDNude4">Nobody's Wife</a>: The first song I heard from her, and her voice totally catched me.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn_CjkNtl6s">Lost</a>: A more quite song for a break.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTabZa3njVs">Modern World</a>: A great song about the toxic beauty norms that society likes to paint.  Lovely!</li>
</ul>

<p>Like always, enjoy!</p>
