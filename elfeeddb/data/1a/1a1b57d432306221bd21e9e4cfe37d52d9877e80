Hello,<br />
<br />
Last season we went from Tarvisio (Italy) to Vienna passing from Slovenia and going back through Salzburg. We travelled along several interesting routes like eurovelo 9, eurovelo 6, eurovelo 7, thermenradweg, alpe adria radweg, murradweg, drauradweg, donauradweg. If you need some helps we are available for every kind of information and gps tracks<br />
