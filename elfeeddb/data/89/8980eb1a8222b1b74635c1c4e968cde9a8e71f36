bunch of friends down in Windermere, so I carried on walking south,
basking in sudden sun as I headed up onto Fairfield from the saddle
by Saint Sunday’s Crag. I still hadn’t met anybody, but a couple of
guys were ensconced in the summit shelter as I passed by, and I was
soon going against the flow as I ploughed downhill into Rydal for the
midday bus.</p><p>I enjoyed the two days
I had on the fells, one solitary prowl and another more social walk with old friends, but the area’s a victim of its
own success (and the grasping hands of a revenue-hungry LDNPA quite
prepared to kill the goose that laid the golden egg). Nice to visit
but I couldn’t live there again.<br/></p>
