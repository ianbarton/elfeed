And that despite advances in climbing  technology and safety some of their climbs remain unrepeated or rarely  tackled.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">“This is a  rare opportunity to hear the three men talk about their achievements and  the motivation required to operate at the cutting edge of climbing  development. It is also a great opportunity for the audience to put  their own questions to them” said Nick Wharton. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">“Paul  Ross, Pete Whillance and Dave Birkett each made rock climbing history  and continue to be passionate about a popular sport that appeals to all  ages. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">“In the 50's  and 60's Paul Ross, from Keswick, established many climbing routes  around Borrowdale, Langdale, Thirlmere and Ennerdale which continue to  challenge climbers today. In the 70's and 80's Pete Whillance  successfully tackled free ascents of notoriously difficult routes which  are still revered and considered too bold for most climbers. They  include the depths of Hodge Close Quarry to the heights of Great Gable  as well as other notable classics in Scotland and Wales. From the 90’s  onwards Dave Birkett, born and bred in Little Langdale, pushed standards  to dizzying new heights. From his first ‘E9’ on Iron Crag in Thirlmere  in 1992, to the current day, he has left the trail of often unrepeated  lines that most climbers struggle to contemplate. Many are on the  buttresses of Scafell, England’s highest mountain, where his grandfather  farmed.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">“The Lake  District has been at the heart of rock climbing developments since the  very earliest days of the sport. Each generation has produced its own  leaders who have set the standards for others to look up to and try to  follow and those legends include Paul, Pete and Dave. </span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">“The  evening brings together three larger-than-life characters who will  share with us their motivation, vision and drive to achieve all they  did. I hope they will inspire the audience to find their own adventures”  he added.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">The evening  is being held at Brathay Hall Clappersgate Ambleside on Friday 16  September at 7pm.
