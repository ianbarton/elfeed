<p>#emacs skeeto (chris wellons, author of elfeed, skewer, etc) answers about lexical binding.

<p>read his comment for detail. But the reason he gave that convinced me that why a file directive for lexical binding is the proper choice instead of a special function such as “lexical-let”. That reason is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It [lexical binding file variable] applies not just to let, but to all forms that create local bindings, such as function parameters, condition-case, and any macros that expand to let.</p>
