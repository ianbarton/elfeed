I've had the pleasure of meeting and climbing with David and had the honour of doing a couple of first ascents with him here in north Wales.For a Scottish climber best known for his English Lake District climbs, it was nice to be able to show him what our local crags had to offer. Particularly- as accompanied by Harold and Neville Drasdo- we sampled some of the local esoterica and showed him that even here in a relatively small area like north Wales, we still have some out of the way crags where only the odd sheep and crow disturb the peace.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">By coincidence, I had only that morning put out a Featured Archive Post of David's- '<a href="http://footlesscrow.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/at-corrie-of-black-raven.html">At the Corrie of the Black Raven</a>', which was a poignant reflection on coming to terms with the end of a climbing life. Anyway...enough of the chatter.
