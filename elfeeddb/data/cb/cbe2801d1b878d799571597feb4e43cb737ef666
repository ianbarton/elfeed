<p class=" text-justify drop-cap">After a long wait Emacs 25 is finally here! It’s tradition that I take the <code>NEWS</code> file and talk about some of the features I find most exciting. So, no more hesitation – on with the news!</p><H2 id="installation-changes-in-emacs-25.1">Installation Changes in Emacs 25.1</H2><pre><code>Building Emacs now requires C99 or later.

Building Emacs now requires GNU make, version 3.81 or later.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">C99 compiler support should bring about many new improvements. I do wonder what feature pushed them over the edge to make it mandatory.</p><pre><code>New configure option --with-modules.
This enables support for loading dynamic modules; see below.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is a huge development. You can now dynamically load modules into Emacs. Useful, in particular, for things that’re hard to do well or not worth replicating in Emacs. I am thinking SQLite could be used directly, which would serve as a very fast backend for TAGS files, full text search, and more.</p><pre><code>New configure option --with-cairo.
This builds Emacs with Cairo drawing.  As a side effect, it provides
support for built-in printing, when Emacs was built with GTK+.
The Emacs Cairo drawing is experimental and still has some known
display problems.  We encourage more testing of this build and
reporting any problems you find, but it is not recommended for
production.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is a rather important development even if you may not want to use it now. It should provide self-sufficiency and portability as Emacs can now handle its own drawing using the Cairo library. I – and I’m pondering about the future, here – wonder if this would result in a neater and faster graphics in Emacs: better (read: nicer) support for in-lining graphics, vector primitives, simple animation and more. Cairo can render to SDL, so that raises an interesting question about a GPU-accelerated Emacs. That would in turn lead to faster rendering. But who knows? It’s early days.</p><p class=" text-justify">But for now, at least, you get free printing even though it’s experimental.</p><pre><code>By default, Emacs no longer works on IRIX.  We expect that Emacs
users are not affected by this, as SGI stopped supporting IRIX in
December 2013.  If you are affected, please send a bug report.  You
should be able to work around the problem either by porting the Emacs
undumping code to GCC under IRIX, or by configuring --with-wide-int,
or by sticking with Emacs 24.4.</code></pre><pre><code>The Emacs garbage collector assumes GC_MARK_STACK == GC_MAKE_GCPROS_NOOPS.
The GC_MAKE_GCPROS_NOOPS stack-marking variant has been the default
since Emacs 24.4, and the other variants were undocumented and were
obstacles to maintenance and development.  GC_MARK_STACK and its
related symbols have been removed from the C internals.</code></pre><pre><code>*configure' now prefers gnustep-config when configuring GNUstep.
If gnustep-config is not available, the old heuristics are used.</code></pre><pre><code>*configure' now prefers inotify to gfile for file notification,
unless gfile is explicitly requested via --with-file-notification='gfile'.</code></pre><pre><code>*configure' detects the kqueue file notification library on *BSD
and Mac OS X machines.</code></pre><pre><code>The configure option '--with-pkg-config-prog' has been removed.
Use './configure PKG_CONFIG=/full/name/of/pkg-config' if you need to.</code></pre><pre><code>The configure option '--with-mmdf' has been removed.
It was no longer useful, as it relied on libraries that are no longer
supported, and its presence led to confusion during configuration.
This affects only the 'movemail' utility; Emacs itself can still
process MMDF-format files as before.</code></pre><pre><code>The configure option '--enable-silent-rules' is now the default,
and silent rules are now quieter.  To get the old behavior where
'make' chatters a lot, configure with '--disable-silent-rules' or
build with 'make V=1'.</code></pre><pre><code>The configure option '--with-gameuser' now allows you to specify a
group instead of a user if its argument is prefixed by ':' (a colon).
This will cause the game score files in "${localstatedir}/games/emacs"
to be owned by that group, and the helper program for updating them to
be installed setgid.  The option now defaults to the 'games' group.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Emacs ships with many games (<code>M-x tetris</code>, <code>M-x pong</code>, <code>M-x snake</code>, etc.) and this change is seemingly limited to which user and group the game state is stored under. I cannot imagine too many people need to worry about this.</p><pre><code>The 'grep-changelog' script (and its manual page) are no longer included.
It has no particular connection to Emacs and has not changed in years,
so if you want to use it, you can always take a copy from an older Emacs.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">I.. never even knew about this feature. From a cursory glance it’s a Perl script that extracts Changelog entries. Not particularly useful and it is unlikely to be missed.</p><pre><code>Emacs 25 comes with a new set of icons.
Various resolutions are available as etc/images/icons/hicolor/*/apps/emacs.png.
The old Emacs logo icons are available as 'emacs23.png' in the same location.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Very much in keeping with the fashion, this logo is in the <em>flat</em> style that is popular on smartphones today.</p><pre><code>New make target 'check-expensive' to run additional tests.
This includes all tests which run via "make check", plus additional
tests which take more time to perform.</code></pre><H2 id="startup-changes-in-emacs-25.1">Startup Changes in Emacs 25.1</H2><pre><code>When Emacs is given a file as a command line argument and
'initial-buffer-choice' is non-nil, display both the file and
'initial-buffer-choice'.  When Emacs is given more than one file and
'initial-buffer-choice' is non-nil, show 'initial-buffer-choice'
and '*Buffer List*'.  This makes Emacs convenient to use from the
command line when 'initial-buffer-choice' is non-nil.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Useful change for the minority of people who customize <code>initial-buffer-choice</code>. I still recommend that people open up files through <code>emacsclient</code> and use the client-server architecture as it re-uses your Emacs session.</p><pre><code>The value of 'initial-scratch-message' is now treated as a doc string
and can contain escape sequences for command keys, quotes, and the like.</code></pre><pre><code>The default height of GUI frames was enlarged.
This is so there's enough space in the initial window to display the
optional text about recovering crashes sessions, without losing the
splash image display.</code></pre><H2 id="changes-in-emacs-25.1">Changes in Emacs 25.1</H2><pre><code>Xwidgets: a new feature for embedding native widgets inside Emacs buffers.
If you have gtk3 and webkitgtk3 installed, and Emacs was built with
xwidget support, you can access the embedded webkit browser with 'M-x
xwidget-webkit-browse-url'.  This opens a new buffer with the embedded
browser.  The buffer will have a new mode, 'xwidget-webkit-mode'
(similar to 'image-mode'), which supports the webkit widget.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is a really cool feature. You can embed other widgets inside Emacs buffers. It’s a feature that Windows users will handily recognize as OLE integration – a staple feature of Windows since the 90s. This feature is more limited, however, as it only works with GTK.</p><p class=" text-justify">For now there is just one feature that makes use of this: the Webkit browser integration. You can now browse web pages with webkit inside Emacs. The feature – having played with it a lot – is in the very early stages still. I would consider it alpha quality, but with it integrated into Emacs progress is likely to be swift.</p><pre><code>*New functions for xwidget-webkit mode 'xwidget-webkit-insert-string',
'xwidget-webkit-adjust-size-dispatch', 'xwidget-webkit-back',
'xwidget-webkit-browse-url', 'xwidget-webkit-reload',
'xwidget-webkit-current-url', 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-backward',
'xwidget-webkit-scroll-forward', 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-down',
'xwidget-webkit-scroll-up'.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs can now load shared/dynamic libraries (modules).
A dynamic Emacs module is a shared library that provides additional
functionality for use in Emacs Lisp programs, just like a package
written in Emacs Lisp would.  The functions 'load', 'require',
'load-file', etc. were extended to load such modules, as they do with
Emacs Lisp packages.  The new variable 'module-file-suffix' holds the
system-dependent value of the file-name extension ('.so' on Posix
hosts) of the module files.

A module should export a C-callable function named
'emacs_module_init', which Emacs will call as part of the call to
'load' or 'require' which loads the module.  It should also export a
symbol named 'plugin_is_GPL_compatible' to indicate that its code is
released under the GPL or compatible license; Emacs will refuse to
load modules that don't export such a symbol.

If a module needs to call Emacs functions, it should do so through the
API defined and documented in the header file 'emacs-module.h'.  Note
that any module that provides Lisp-callable functions will have to use
Emacs functions such as 'fset' and 'funcall', in order to register its
functions with the Emacs Lisp interpreter.

Modules can create 'user-ptr' Lisp objects that embed pointers to C
structs defined by the module.  This is useful for keeping around
complex data structures created by a module, to be passed back to the
module's functions.  User-ptr objects can also have associated
"finalizers" -- functions to be run when the object is GC'ed; this is
useful for freeing any resources allocated for the underlying data
structure, such as memory, open file descriptors, etc.  A new
predicate 'user-ptrp' returns non-nil if its argument is a 'user-ptr'
object.

Loadable modules in Emacs are an experimental feature, and subject to
change in future releases.  For that reason, their support is disabled
by default, and must be enabled by using the '--with-modules' option
at configure time.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">As I talked about above, the new dynamic module feature is a welcome addition. However, the requirement that you must export a symbol named <code>plugin_is_GPL_compatible</code> does greatly limit the amount of out-of-box support for Emacs, as that symbol must be exported before the module can be loaded, even if the module is licensed under GPL already. I imagine it won’t be long before someone writes a generic shim or patch that overrides this behaviour for people who are disinclined to limit themselves to just GPL-compatible modules.</p><pre><code>Network security (TLS/SSL certificate validity and the like) is
added via the new Network Security Manager (NSM) and controlled via
the 'network-security-level' variable.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Excellent consolidation of security control, and security alerts, in Emacs. You can now define how explicit Emacs should be when it encounters some scenarios that are potential risks, such as: unable to verify a TLS certificate; whether a self-signed certificate has changed; if a connection is suddenly unencrypted if it were previously encrypted before; and much more.</p><p class=" text-justify">If you are security conscious you can control the level of feedback by customizing <code>network-security</code>.</p><pre><code>*C-h l' now also lists the commands that were run.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">The lossage function in Emacs was historically a bit anaemic; most Emacsers, myself included, never really used it much as it would only display the key and not the command. That has now changed and as a result it’s so much more useful. You can now combine it with the <code>kmacro-edit-lossage</code> and edit the last 300 keys and create a macro from it. Far more useful when you can see actually see the command that each key ran!</p><pre><code>*x-select-enable-clipboard' is renamed 'select-enable-clipboard'
and 'x-select-enable-primary' is renamed 'select-enable-primary'.
Additionally they both now apply to all systems (OSX, GNUstep, Windows, you
name it), with the proviso that on some systems (e.g. Windows)
'select-enable-primary' is ineffective since the system doesn't
have the equivalent of a primary selection.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify"><em>Thank you</em>. I never could remember which setting did which and on what operating system, so having one set of variables to control the clipboard behavior is useful indeed.</p><pre><code>New option 'switch-to-buffer-in-dedicated-window' allows you to
customize how 'switch-to-buffer' proceeds interactively when the
selected window is strongly dedicated to its buffer.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Emacs’s windows are locked in an eternal fight with their user as they fight over screen estate and what buffer is allowed to be shown where. The concept of strongly dedicated window is alien to most Emacs users as it’s fairly byzantine to figure out. This variable, which is customizable, will let you decide how buffer switching works when a window and its buffer are fundamentally entwined. I recommend you set it to <code>prompt</code> if you are curious about its effects, as that will prompt you to decide what to do next — no doubt annoying in the long run, but useful for figuring out how Emacs’s windowing mechanics work.</p><pre><code>The option 'even-window-heights' has been renamed to
'even-window-sizes' and now handles window widths as well.</code></pre><pre><code>*terpri' gets an optional arg ENSURE to conditionally output a newline.</code></pre><pre><code>*insert-register' now leaves point after the inserted text
when called interactively.  A prefix argument toggles this behavior.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is a good change but one that is likely to break macros that depend on the old behavior which is to leave the point <em>before</em> the inserted register text. I like this change a lot as I kept screwing up my macros because I naturally assume the point is left <em>after</em> inserting the register text. I am glad this is now “fixed.”</p><pre><code>The new variable 'term-file-aliases' replaces some files from lisp/term.
The function 'tty-run-terminal-initialization' consults this variable
when deciding what terminal-specific initialization code to run.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'system-configuration-features', listing some of the
main features that Emacs was compiled with.  This is mainly intended
for use in Emacs bug reports.</code></pre><pre><code>A password is now hidden also when typed in batch mode.  Another
hiding character but the default '.' can be used by let-binding the
variable 'read-hide-char'.</code></pre><pre><code>The Emacs pseudo-random number generator can be securely seeded.
On systems where Emacs can access the system entropy or some other
cryptographically secure random stream, it now uses that when 'random'
is called with its argument t.  This allows cryptographically strong
random values; in particular, the Emacs server now uses this facility
to produce its authentication key.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Good news if you want to the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm with proper entropy :)</p><pre><code>New input methods: 'tamil-dvorak', 'programmer-dvorak' and 'probhat'.</code></pre><H2 id="editing-changes-in-emacs-25.1">Editing Changes in Emacs 25.1</H2><pre><code>'M-x' suggests shorthands and ignores obsolete commands for completion.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Helpful for new and old users alike. I recommend you try out the package <code>smex</code> for command completion though.</p><pre><code>*Successive single-char deletions are collapsed in the undo-log just like
successive char insertions.  Which commands invoke this behavior is
controlled by the new 'undo-auto-amalgamate' function.  See the node
"Undo" in the ELisp manual for more details.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is a rather big change that is going to catch people out at first. Muscle memory will have to be re-learned, but I do think it’s a positive change. It was quite asymmetric to have insertions logged as a single item but not deletes.</p><pre><code>*The heuristic used to insert 'undo-boundary' after each command
has changed, so that if a command causes changes in more than just the
current buffer, Emacs now calls 'undo-boundary' in every buffer
affected by the command.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is unlikely to affect most people except hopefully for the better. I believe this change is to do with indirect buffers (a way of having blocks of text in one buffer represented in another) and this change should mean that undos now propagate correctly.</p><pre><code>New command 'comment-line' bound to 'C-x C-;'.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">In theory quite useful, but the commenting semantics are not the same as <code>M-x comment-dwim</code> (<code>M-;</code>) so I do not know how much I will end up using it myself.</p><pre><code>New and improved facilities for inserting Unicode characters

Unicode names entered via 'C-x 8 RET' now use substring completion
by default.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Good news for those of us who insert unicode characters frequently. I quite like Helm’s <code>helm-ucs</code> for this though.</p><pre><code>**C-x 8' now has shorthands for several chars, such as U+2010
(HYPHEN), U+2011 (NON-BREAKING HYPHEN), and U+2012 (FIGURE DASH).  As
before, you can type 'C-x 8 C-h' to list shorthands.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">If you’ve ever written a book – believe me – you will find this useful.</p><pre><code>*New minor mode 'electric-quote-mode' for using curved quotes as you
type.  See also the new variable 'text-quoting-style'.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This, importantly, unlike <code>electric-pair-mode</code>, <em>requotes</em> the characters you type to match the styles in <code>text-quoting-style</code>. Seemingly no support for guillemets, to the annoyance of continental Europeans!</p><pre><code>New minor mode 'global-eldoc-mode' is enabled by default.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">I like this change, in theory, but some major modes may not be set up right and unknowingly trigger errors. If you suddenly get strange error messages when you program in your favorite language – try disabling <code>eldoc-mode</code>.</p><pre><code>Emacs now uses "bracketed paste mode" on text terminals that support it.
Bracketed paste mode causes text terminals to wrap pasted text in special
escape sequences that allow Emacs to tell the difference between text
you type and text you paste from other applications.  Emacs then
avoids interpreting each character in the pasted text as it does with
keyboard input, which results in a paste experience similar to that
under a window system, and significant performance improvements when
pasting large amounts of text.

Bracketed paste mode is disabled by default, so Emacs automatically
enables it at startup if the terminal supports it.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Good stuff if you use terminal Emacs.</p><pre><code>Emacs now supports the latest version of the UBA.
The Emacs implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UBA)
was updated to support all the latest additions and changes introduced
in Unicode Standard versions 6.3, 7.0, and the latest Unicode 8.0.
This includes full support for directional isolates and the
Bidirectional Parentheses Algorithm (BPA) specified by these Unicode
standards.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Additional code points is always a benefit.</p><pre><code>You can access 'mouse-buffer-menu' ('C-down-mouse-1') using 'C-f10'.</code></pre><pre><code>New buffer-local 'electric-pair-local-mode'.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'fast-but-imprecise-scrolling' inhibits
fontification during full screen scrolling operations, giving less
hesitant operation during auto-repeat of 'C-v', 'M-v' at the cost of
possible inaccuracies in the end position.</code></pre><pre><code>New documentation command 'describe-symbol'.
Works for functions, variables, faces, etc.  It is bound to 'C-h o' by
default.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Handy all-in-one describe command, but I will probably never remember to use it.</p><pre><code>New function 'custom-prompt-customize-unsaved-options' checks for
unsaved customizations and prompts user to customize (if found).  It
is intended for adding to 'kill-emacs-query-functions'.</code></pre><pre><code>The old 'C-x w' bindings in 'hi-lock-mode' are officially deprecated
in favor of the global 'M-s h' bindings introduced in Emacs 23.1.
They'll disappear soon.</code></pre><H2 id="changes-in-specialized-modes-and-packages-in-emacs-25.1">Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 25.1</H2><pre><code>*New command 'checkdoc-package-keywords' checks if the
current package keywords are recognized.  Set the new option
'checkdoc-package-keywords-flag' to non-nil to make
'checkdoc-current-buffer' call this function automatically.</code></pre><pre><code>*New function 'checkdoc-file' checks for style errors.
It's meant for use together with 'compile':
emacs -batch --eval "(checkdoc-file \"subr.el\")"</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Useful for package authors. Additional linting checks are always welcome.</p><pre><code>*The desktop format version has been upgraded from 206 to 208.
Although Emacs 25.1 can read a version 206 desktop, earlier Emacsen
cannot read a version 208 desktop.  To upgrade your desktop file, you
must explicitly request the upgrade, by 'C-u M-x desktop-save'.  You are
recommended to do this as soon as you have firmly upgraded to Emacs
25.1 (or later).  Should you ever need to downgrade your desktop file
to version 206, you can do this with 'C-u C-u M-x desktop-save'.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">If you use desktop files and you swap between 25.1 and the older one the new format is not backwards compatible.</p><pre><code>**desktop-restore-in-current-display' now defaults to t, not nil.
That is, Emacs by default now restores frames into the current display.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'bookmark-set-no-overwrite' bound to 'C-x r M'.
It raises an error if a bookmark of that name already exists,
unlike 'bookmark-set' which silently updates an existing bookmark.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Interesting that they chose to make this a new command and not simply a customizable variable for the existing <code>C-x r m</code> key.</p><H3 id="gnus">Gnus</H3><pre><code>*New user options 'mm-html-inhibit-images' and 'mm-html-blocked-images'
now control how mm-* functions fetch and display images in an HTML
message.  Gnus still uses 'gnus-inhibit-images' and 'gnus-blocked-images'
for that purpose, i.e., binds mm-html- variables with those gnus-
variables, but other packages do not have to bind gnus- variables now.</code></pre><pre><code>**mm-inline-text-html-with-images' has been removed.
Use 'mm-html-inhibit-images' instead.  Note that the value is opposite
in meaning.</code></pre><H3 id="imap">IMAP</H3><pre><code>**imap-ssl-program' has been removed, and imap.el uses the internal
GnuTLS encryption functions if possible.</code></pre><H3 id="json">JSON</H3><pre><code>**json-encode-string' now only escapes the characters it has to.
Which means that the encoded strings can contain non-ASCII characters.</code></pre><pre><code>**json-pretty-print' and 'json-pretty-print-buffer' now maintain
the ordering of object keys by default.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">I am glad they added pretty printing of JSON. For many, many years I have lugged around a windows and Linux binary of <code>tidy</code> to do just that to JSON, XML and HTML files. I guess I can deprecate one of those three commands now.</p><pre><code>*New commands 'json-pretty-print-ordered' and
'json-pretty-print-buffer-ordered' pretty prints JSON objects with
object keys sorted alphabetically.</code></pre><H3 id="prettify-symbols-mode">Prettify Symbols mode</H3><pre><code>*Prettify Symbols mode supports custom composition predicates.  By
overriding the default 'prettify-symbols-compose-predicate', modes can
specify in which contexts a symbol may be displayed as some Unicode
character.  'prettify-symbols-default-compose-p' is the default which
is suitable for most programming languages such as C or Lisp (but not
(La)TeX).</code></pre><pre><code>*Symbols can be unprettified while point is inside them.
New variable 'prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point' configures this.</code></pre><H3 id="enhanced-xterm-support">Enhanced xterm support</H3><pre><code>*The new variable 'xterm-screen-extra-capabilities' for configuring xterm.
This variable tells Emacs which advanced capabilities are available in
the xterm terminal emulator used to display Emacs text-mode frames.
The default is to check each capability, and use it if available.
(This variable was introduced in Emacs 24.1, but was not announced in
its NEWS.)</code></pre><pre><code>*Killing text now also sets the CLIPBOARD/PRIMARY selection
in the surrounding GUI (using the OSC-52 escape sequence).  This only works
if your xterm supports it and enables the 'allowWindowOps' options (disabled
by default at least in Debian, for security reasons).

Similarly, you can yank the CLIPBOARD/PRIMARY selection (using the OSC-52
escape sequence) if your xterm has the feature enabled but for that you
additionally need to add 'getSelection' to 'xterm-extra-capabilities'.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This is excellent news for people who make use of terminal Emacs. I did not even know that you could do this.</p><pre><code>'xterm-mouse-mode' now supports mouse-tracking (if your xterm supports it).</code></pre><pre><code>The way to turn on and off 'save-place' mode has changed.
It is no longer sufficient to load the saveplace library and set
'save-place' non-nil.  Instead, use the two new minor modes:
'save-place-mode' turns on saving last place in every file, and
'save-place-local-mode' does that only for the file in whose buffer it
is invoked.  The 'save-place' variable is now an obsolete alias for
'save-place-mode', which replaces it, and 'toggle-save-place' is an
obsolete alias for the new 'save-place-local-mode' command.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Wow. I’ve been an Emacs user for 13 years and I didn’t even know <em>Emacs had this feature</em>. Very nice if you come from an editor or IDE that has this.</p><H3 id="erc">ERC</H3><pre><code>ERC can now hide message types by network or channel.
'erc-hide-list' will hide all messages of the specified type, while
'erc-network-hide-list' and 'erc-channel-hide-list' will only hide the
specified message types for the respective specified targets.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">That is very nice indeed. I had built something similar myself as I get sick and tired of seeing endless JOIN/PART/QUIT messages. I am glad that this is now standard in ERC.</p><pre><code>Reconnection is now asynchronous.</code></pre><pre><code>Nick completion is now case-insensitive again after inadvertently

An external package is any installed package that's not built-in and
not from 'package-user-dir', which usually means it's from an entry in
'package-directory-list'.  They are treated much like built-in
packages, in that they cannot be deleted through the package menu and
are not considered for upgrades.

The effect is that a user can manually place a specific version of a
package inside 'package-directory-list' and the package menu will
always respect that.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">This sounds useful if you have packages that must exist outside the normal package ecosystem.</p><pre><code>If a package is available on multiple archives and one has higher
priority (as per 'package-archive-priorities') only that one is
listed.  This can be configured with 'package-menu-hide-low-priority'.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Good news if you want packages in some order, such as MELPA-Stable -&gt; MELPA -&gt; ELPA.</p><pre><code>'package-menu-toggle-hiding' now toggles the hiding of packages.
This includes the above-mentioned low-priority packages, as well as
available packages whose version is lower than the currently installed

This allows users to downgrade a package if a lower version is
available.</code></pre><pre><code>When filtering the package menu, keywords starting with "arc:" or
"status:" represent package archive or status, respectively, instead
of actual keywords.</code></pre><pre><code>Most functions which involve downloading information now take an
ASYNC argument.  If it is non-nil, package.el performs the download(s)
asynchronously.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'package-menu-async' controls whether the
package-menu uses asynchronous downloads.</code></pre><pre><code>'package-install-from-buffer' and 'package-install-file' work on directories.

This is analogous to case folding, but instead of disregarding case
variants, it disregards wider classes of distinctions between similar
characters.  (Case folding is a special case of character folding.)
This means many characters in the search string will match entire
groups of characters instead of just themselves.

For instance, the ASCII double quote character " will match all
variants of double quotes, and the letter 'a' will match all of its
accented cousins, even those composed of multiple characters, as well
as many other symbols like U+249C (PARENTHESIZED LATIN SMALL LETTER
A).

Character folding is enabled by customizing 'search-default-mode' to
the value 'char-fold-to-regexp'.  You can also toggle character
folding in the middle of a search by typing 'M-s ''.

'query-replace' honors character folding if the new variable
'replace-char-fold' is customized to a non-nil value.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">I <em>like</em> this option but it did spawn a huge discussion about the semantics of folding characters into their naive ASCII (or should we just say Anglophone?) counterparts.

as in previous Emacs versions).</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'char-fold-to-regexp' can be used

string defined by the new variable 'query-replace-from-to-separator'.
To select a prior replacement, type 'M-p' until the desired
replacement appears in the minibuffer, and then exit the minibuffer by
typing RET.</code></pre><p class=" text-justify">Another hugely welcome improvement.

The effect is that, on systems that use ls-lisp for Dired, the default
sort order of the files in Dired is now different from what it was in
previous versions of Emacs.  In particular, the file names are sorted
disregarding punctuation, accents, and diacritics, and letter case is
ignored.  For example, files whose name begin with a period will no
longer appear near the beginning of the directory listing.  If you

In particular, it now returns the average width of the font's
characters, which can be used for geometry-related calculations.</code></pre><pre><code>A new function 'default-font-width' returns the average width of a
character in the current buffer's default font.  If the default face
is remapped (see 'face-remapping-alist'), the value for the remapped
face is returned.  This function complements the existing function
'default-font-height'.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions 'window-font-height' and 'window-font-width' return

clock time, or a string as in the TZ environment variable.  The
affected functions are 'current-time-string', 'current-time-zone',
'decode-time', and 'format-time-string'.  The function 'encode-time',
which already accepted a simple time zone rule argument, has been
extended to accept all the new forms.</code></pre><pre><code>Incompatible change in the third argument of 'format-time-string'.
Previously, any non-nil argument was interpreted as specifying Universal Time.

of the Emacs process to binary I/O mode.</code></pre><pre><code>The new function 'directory-name-p' can be used to check whether a file
name (as returned from, for instance, 'file-name-all-completions') is
a directory file name.  It returns non-nil if the last character in

two specify height and type of the window's horizontal scroll bar.</code></pre><pre><code>'window-scroll-bars' now returns type and sizes of horizontal scroll
bars too.</code></pre><pre><code>New buffer-local variables 'horizontal-scroll-bar' and
'scroll-bar-height'.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions 'frame-geometry' and 'frame-edges' give access to a
frame's geometry.</code></pre><pre><code>New functions 'mouse-absolute-pixel-position' and
'set-mouse-absolute-pixel-position' get/set screen coordinates of the
mouse cursor.</code></pre><pre><code>The function 'window-edges' now accepts three additional arguments to
retrieve body, absolute and pixel edges of the window.</code></pre><pre><code>The functions 'window-inside-edges', 'window-inside-pixel-edges' and
'window-inside-absolute-pixel-edges' have been renamed to respectively
'window-body-edges', 'window-body-pixel-edges' and
'window-absolute-body-pixel-edges'.  The old names are kept as aliases.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'window-absolute-pixel-position' to get the screen
coordinates of a visible buffer position.</code></pre><pre><code>The height of a frame's menu and tool bar are no longer counted in the
frame's text height.  This means that the text height stands only for
the height of the frame's root window plus that of the echo area (if
present).  This was already the behavior for frames with external tool
and menu bars (like in the Gtk builds) but has now been extended to all
builds.</code></pre><pre><code>Frames now do not necessarily preserve the number of columns or lines
they display when setting default font, menu bar, fringe width, or
scroll bars.  In particular, maximized and fullscreen frames are
conceptually never resized if such settings change.  For fullheight and
fullwidth frames, the behavior may depend on the toolkit used.</code></pre><pre><code>New option 'frame-inhibit-implied-resize' if non-nil, means that
setting default font, menu bar, fringe width, or scroll bars of a
specific frame does not resize that frame in order to preserve the
number of columns or lines it displays.</code></pre><pre><code>New function 'window-preserve-size' allows you to preserve the size of
a window without "fixing" it.  It's supported by 'fit-window-to-buffer',
'temp-buffer-resize-mode' and 'display-buffer'.</code></pre><pre><code>New 'display-buffer' action function 'display-buffer-use-some-frame'.
This displays the buffer in an existing frame other than the current
frame, and allows the caller to specify a frame predicate to exclude
frames.</code></pre><pre><code>New minor mode 'window-divider-mode' and options
'window-divider-default-places', 'window-divider-default-bottom-width'
and 'window-divider-default-right-width'.</code></pre><pre><code>When a window is shrunk horizontally its margins are no longer removed
automatically.  Rather, Emacs refuses to split or resize windows when
this would cause margins to no longer fit into the width reserved for the
corresponding window.  An application can override this behavior for a
particular window by setting that window's 'min-margins' parameter.  As
a consequence, the application becomes fully responsible for trimming
the margin sizes of that window and any window inheriting these margins.</code></pre><pre><code>The window displaying the '*Completions*' buffer with minibuffer
completion candidates is now shown at the bottom of the selected
frame.  The size of that window is always as large as required to
display all the candidates, except when limited by the minimum size
of the other windows on that frame; those other windows are resized
to provide space for the '*Completions*' display.  The Emacs manual
describes how to customize 'display-buffer-alist' to get back the old
behavior, see the node "Temporary Displays" there.</code></pre><pre><code>Tearoff menus and detachable toolbars for Gtk+ have been removed.
Those features have been deprecated in Gtk+ for a long time.</code></pre><H2 id="etags">Etags</H2><pre><code>etags no longer qualifies class members by default.

By default, 'etags' will not qualify class members for Perl and C-like
object-oriented languages with their class names and namespaces, and
will remove qualifications used explicitly in the code from the tag
names it puts in TAGS files.  This is so the etags.el back-end for
'xref-find-definitions' is more accurate and produces less false
positives.

Use --class-qualify (-Q) if you want the old default behavior of
qualifying class members in C++, Java, Objective C, and Perl.  Note
that using -Q might make some class members become "unknown" to 'M-.'
('xref-find-definitions'); if so, you can use 'C-u M-.' to specify the
qualified names by hand.</code></pre><pre><code>New language Ruby

Names of modules, classes, methods, functions, and constants are

This includes the makefile.w32-in files in various subdirectories, and
the support files.  The file nt/configure.bat now just tells the user
to use the procedure described in nt/INSTALL, by running the Posix
'configure' script in the top-level directory.</code></pre><pre><code>Building Emacs for MS-Windows requires at least Windows XP
or Windows Server 2003.  The built binaries still run on all versions
of Windows starting with Windows 9X.</code></pre><pre><code>Emacs running on MS-Windows now supports the daemon mode.</code></pre><pre><code>The byte counts in etags-generated TAGS files are now the same on
MS-Windows as they are on other platforms.</code></pre><pre><code>On OS X, configure creates a Cocoa ("Nextstep") build by default.

animation when entering and leaving fullscreen.  For native OSX fullscreen
this has no effect.</code></pre><pre><code>On the OS X Cocoa ("Nextstep") port, multicolor font (such as color
emoji) display is disabled.  This feature was accidentally added when
Emacs 24.4 included the new Core Text based font backend code that was
originally implemented for a non-mainline port.  This will be enabled
again once it is also implemented in Emacs on free operating systems.
If some symbols, such as emoji, do not display, we suggest to install
an appropriate font, such as Symbola; then they will be displayed,
albeit without the color effects.</code></pre><pre><code>The new function 'w32-application-type' returns the type of an
MS-Windows application given the name of its executable program file.</code></pre><pre><code>New variable 'w32-pipe-buffer-size'.
It can be used to tune the size of the buffer of pipes created for
communicating with subprocesses, when the program run by a subprocess
exhibits unusual buffering behavior.  Default is zero, which lets the
OS use its default size.</code></pre>
