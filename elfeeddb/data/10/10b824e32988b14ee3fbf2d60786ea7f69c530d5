<a href="https://www.cyclechat.net/members/6168/" class="username" data-user="6168, @Littgull">@Littgull</a> and I are riding over to Buckstones on Saturday. I will be starting from Todmorden at 09:30 and riding over to Littleborough where I will meet Littgull at just before 10:00. If you would like to do the ride, you would be welcome to join us.<br />
<br />
You could start and finish with me, Or if you prefer a Littleborough start and finish, meet Brian there and wait for me to arrive with any other Tod starters and ride back from Tod with him at the end.<br />
<br />
There will be a cafe...<br />
