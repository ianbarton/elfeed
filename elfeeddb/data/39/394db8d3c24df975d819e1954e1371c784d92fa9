<p>Hey V1del,</p><p>it seems like I focussed too much on ALSA; I only experimented with the Audio settings in the KDE system settings (which controls basically pulseaudio, right?), but that didn&#039;t work out... </p><p>So after installing the 3 packages which you recommended everything works like a charm! Reading your post about ALSA exclusive access helped me understanding what happend, thanks for that <img src="https://bbs.archlinux.org/img/smilies/smile.png" width="15" height="15" alt="smile" /></p><p>And for the next time I know that everything can be found in the Arch wiki, I should have read through the Pulseaudio article during the installation and make sure that it is properly configured.</p><p>Thank you again for the help, I really appreciate it.<br />aventurin</p>
