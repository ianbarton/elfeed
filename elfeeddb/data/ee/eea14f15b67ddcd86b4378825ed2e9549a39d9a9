Toshi, who has climbed several ~8C's calls this hard for the grade and says it could very well be ~8C+.

Kuzan is an extension to Tatsuya Muraoka's problem Borsalino, ~8B+, and is according to Toshi an ~8B+ followed by an ~8B dyno.

He says that it's an honour to add a new vision for this legendary problem, and that he is very proud.

This was his 7th of the grade and his 3rd first ascent.
