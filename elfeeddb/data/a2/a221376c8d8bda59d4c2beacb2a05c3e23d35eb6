Went out for a quick blast after work yesterday with a pal and very soon after leaving Whalley we passed downwind of a farmer spraying cow slurry over his field. Too late we realised that a cloud of fine brown mist was drifting across the road and we rode straight into it.<br />

Now I know what cow slurry tastes like. My riding glasses were half-obscured by tiny brown droplets and my kit stank. We stopped up the road and washed our mouths then carried on taking care not to lick our lips. As soon...<br />
