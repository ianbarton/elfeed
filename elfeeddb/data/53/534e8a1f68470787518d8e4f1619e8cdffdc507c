<p>BSidesSF 2017 was, by far, the best yet.  I’ve been to the last 5 or so, and had
a blast at almost every one.  This year, I was super busy – gave a talk, ran a
workshop, and I was one of the organizers for the BSidesSF CTF.  I’ve posted
<a href="https://systemoverlord.com/projects/assessing_embedded_devices">the summary and slides for my talk</a>
and I’ll update the video link once it gets posted.</p>

<p>I think it’s important to thank the BSidesSF organizers – they did a phenomenal
job with an even bigger venue and I think everyone loved it.  It was clearly a
success, and I can only imagine how much work it takes to plan something like
this.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that our perennial venue, DNA Lounge, (except that
one year we don’t talk about) is <a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2016/12/19.html">having some money
problems</a>.
Apparently you can’t spend more than you bring in each year.  This is the venue
that, in addition to hosting BSidesSF, also hosts
<a href="https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2017/02-14.html">Cyberdelia</a>.  This is a
venue that allows all kinds of independent art and events to thrive in one of
the most expensive cities in the country.  I encourage you to reach out and go
to a show, buy some pizza, or just donate to their Patreon.  If my encouragement
is not enough, how about some from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTZUv6NT3b4">Razor and
Blade</a>?</p>

<p>Again, big thanks to BSidesSF and DNA Lounge for such a successful event!</p>
