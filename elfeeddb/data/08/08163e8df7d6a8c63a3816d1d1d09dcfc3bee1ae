Hi All!<br />
<br />
What about CC Ecosse touring Mull this year?<br />
Weekend 16/17/18 June 2017, checking out on the Monday.<br />
I&#039;m looking at Tobermory Youth Hostel for accommodation, but we need to decide fast as it is almost full. There are other options for places to stay, I will propose them once I know how many will attend.<br />
You can get there anyway you like, <a href="https://www.cyclechat.net/members/41681/" class="username" data-user="41681, @flyingfifi">@flyingfifi</a> and I will be cycling there and back of course :-D<br />
We tour the island and as usual we will have a ball of a time,...<br />
