This isn’t an optional extra for me, some bolt-on lifestyle accessory I’ve read about in a magazine. Last night, 21:45, I thought ‘fuck it’ and took the bike out for an evening spin. It cleared out the cobwebs, even if I did find that one of my favourite local tracks can be a tad sketchy when mulched leaves are laid down over Mendips mud…despite riding like a bag of spanners, the temptation to load up the bikepacking gear and just keep going into the night was almost overwhelming. Anyway, off to work now, hooray!</p>
