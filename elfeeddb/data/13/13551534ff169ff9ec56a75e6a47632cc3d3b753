<p>I&#039;ve gotten League of Legends on my system using the Installation guide (utilising the Wine Method) found here: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/League_of_Legends" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/League_of_Legends</a>.</p><p>I&#039;ve got the application to launch and open up. The sound plays fine, the animation plays fine.</p><p>When I type in my details (Username and password) and sign in, it says &#039;authenicating...&#039; for 3 secs and then breaks with the &#039;Whoops! Something broke&#039; window popping up.</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
