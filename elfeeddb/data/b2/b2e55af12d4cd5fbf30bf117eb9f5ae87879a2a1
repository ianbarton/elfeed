You may already be familiar with the carten100 from Cardiff to Tenby.......well to add a little extra we are thinking of doing the route to Tenby on a Friday.....adding a local ride on the Saturday........and then cycling back to Cardiff on the Sunday.....so 200+ miles in 3 days<br />
Looking for any recommendations of hotels in the area that would happily put up with a group of old blokes and their bikes for a couple of nights in the Spring.....Any thoughts?
