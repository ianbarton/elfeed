<p>My latest review <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/news/gear-review-backpacking-rucksacks/0014671/" target="_blank">is up here</a> and is backpacking rucksacks. I suppose given my predisposition for wanting not-heavy and having pockets the winners were never in doubt but the big beasts in there still had their good points.</p>
<p>More than that is the fact that I am now desperate to get out into the hills for the night after finishing the write up. I missed my chances with the recent fantastic weather and it&#8217;s pish out there just now.</p>
