The brand has issued a call for hikers, climbers and other outdoor enthusiasts to put the latest Berghaus gear through its paces in a series of photoshoots that will take place this year.  The company is recruiting a bank of people who it can call on to appear during shoots in a variety of UK outdoor locations throughout 2017, starting next month.
