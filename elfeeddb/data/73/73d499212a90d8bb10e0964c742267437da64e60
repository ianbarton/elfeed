<p style="text-align:justify;">As a camper van neophyte, it was obvious after my first trip that I needed some bits and pieces to fully kit out my camper. So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve bought so far (with some hyperlinks to products where appropriate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Bedding etc.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My camper has leather seats, which are rather sumptuous, but quite cold to sleep on. To give a bit of insulation, I bought some thin CCF <a href="http://www.needlesports.com/3463/products/beacons-products-tent-underlay-1-5m-wide-by-per-metre-length.aspx" target="_blank">tent underlay from Needle Sports </a>and cut to size. To make it even more comfortable I&#8217;ve added a <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-fleece-blanket/p1621579?colour=Steel" target="_blank">fleece throw</a> from John Lewis and some <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/harlequin-fractal-cushion/p3019193?colour=Peacock" target="_blank">cushions </a>for when I&#8217;m lazing around. I pondered whether to have a normal pillow, but decided that a blow up pillow would be more practical, so I got a <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/sleeping-bags-c21/pillows-c61/aeros-premium-pillow-p3581" target="_blank">Sea to Summit Aeros Premium</a> pillow. It also gives me some flexibility to use it if I want some extra comfort when backpacking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kitchen stuff</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I don&#8217;t need pans as I&#8217;ve got some Kovea titanium ones that I used to use for backpacking. For when I&#8217;ve got electrical hookup, I&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.robertdyas.co.uk/russell-hobbs-chester-compact-kettle" target="_blank">compact 3-cup electric kettle</a>. For when I&#8217;m not on hookup, I&#8217;ve bought an <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/kitchen-stuff-c8/pots-and-pans-c9/terra-kettle-p283" target="_blank">Optimus camping kettle</a>. I decided that it was better to get disposable picnic  plates, bowls, cutlery and plastic glasses from my local supermarket rather than a melamine picnic set. However, for mugs, I decided some decent <a href="http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/travel-bottles--mugs---flasks/thermocafe-desk-mug-045l-purple" target="_blank">Thermos insulated ones</a> were worth getting. Finally, I wanted a washing up bowl, but thought a rigid plastic one was overkill, so I bought a collapsible <a href="https://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/equipment-c3/kitchen-stuff-c8/kitchen-accessories-c18/ultra-sil-kitchen-sink-p6148" target="_blank">Sea to Summit </a>one. To complete the kitchen stuff, I&#8217;ve got a collection of dish cloths and scourers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Storage, cleaning, heating and safety</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For storage, <a href="http://www.homebase.co.uk/en/homebaseuk/whambox-set-of-3-handy-storage-boxes---9l-276034" target="_blank">Whambox 9L crates</a> are about the right size to fit under the seats. They are large enough to get a decent amount of stuff in, but small enough to be flexible. For cleaning, besides a dustpan and brush, I bought a <a href="http://www.robertdyas.co.uk/beldray-bel0581r-quick-vac-lite-cordless-vacuum-cleaner" target="_blank">compact cordless vacuum cleaner</a>. This is brilliant, not just in the van, but around the house. For rubbish, I got a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KGW5GHO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">compact 10L fliptop bin</a>, which fits nicely between the front seats and is small to store away. For the main seating area, I wanted a rug, but couldn&#8217;t find any the right size. Then I came across a site selling <a href="https://www.carpetrunnersuk.co.uk//hallway-carpet-runners-c37/by-type-c86/sisal-c375/rumba-grey-hall-runner-p1569/s73322" target="_blank">hallway runners</a>, which was perfect for my purposes. While the van has a heater which runs off the fuel tank, I thought it would be a good idea to have an <a href="http://www.robertdyas.co.uk/fine-elements-1500w-ceramic-fan-heater" target="_blank">electric fan heater</a> for when I&#8217;m hooked up to electric. It can also be used as a fan without heating. Lastly, for safety, I purchased a small <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kidde-Monoxide-replaceable-batteries-Warranty/dp/B00ABGEL62/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1480503277&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=kidde+co2+alarm" target="_blank">carbon monoxide detector</a> for when I&#8217;m using the gas hob.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Van accessories</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I found the steering wheel on the Alphard a bit sticky as it&#8217;s plastic, so I bought a cheap <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01M132N39/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">leather steering wheel cover</a>. It&#8217;s a bit of a pig to get on, but feels much nicer. For my phone, I got a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00VWSSXUS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">CD slot phone holder</a>. I&#8217;ve used one on my other car, and it&#8217;s great to have the phone to hand and to be able to patch it into the stereo via a USB lead. Although I&#8217;ve got internal insulated screens for the windscreen and side front windows, you get a lot of condensation in cold weather, so I&#8217;ve ordered a<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01LPM25PY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank"> windscreen insulated snow cover</a>. This should help both with insulation and with not having to de-ice the windscreen. Lastly, I bought some foot well mats to save the carpet getting dirty. I bought some cheapo carpet ones from Halford&#8217;s, but they slide about too much, so I may replace them with heavier rubber ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some other bits and pieces I&#8217;m going to need. I&#8217;m looking forward to my next trip in mid-December where I&#8217;m combining a couple of days in the Lake District with picking up our daughter from university.</p>
