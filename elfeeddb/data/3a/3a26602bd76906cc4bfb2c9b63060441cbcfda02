A few hardy CCers will be riding from Cardiff to Croydon in the summer. Plan is to leave Cardiff at midnight.   <a href="https://ridewithgps.com/routes/18585674" target="_blank" class="externalLink" rel="nofollow">This is the proposed route</a> and any local knowledge on alternate routing or really cracking roads that must be sought out will be most welcome.<br />

Thanks
