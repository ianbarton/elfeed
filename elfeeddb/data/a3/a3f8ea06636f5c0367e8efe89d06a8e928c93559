Tried pressing each while looking at the flags from list-sinks between with no change. </p><div class="quotebox"><cite>V1del wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><p>The volume on your sink is at 25% are you sure that that&#039;s loud enough for you to hear something? I somewhat agree with the notion that maybe a hardware switch might be triggered somewhere, other than that, sometimes it also happens that pulse switches the profile but the hardware mapping is incorrect. So you might want to try to enforce a switch to the speakers and check if you get output from the headphones by using </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output-speaker</code></pre></div><p> as for the auto-mute @JB it is currently disabled as can be seen in the amixer output, but still maybe toggling that around might help.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>Yeah I&#039;ve tried changing the volume around with headphones plugged in, and I can see the levels increase correspondingly but still not output. I also tried running that command you mentioned which did change the output to speakers which worked, then tried changing back to headphones in pavucontrol and still no output <img src="https://bbs.archlinux.org/img/smilies/hmm.png" width="15" height="15" alt="hmm" /></p><p>I&#039;ve also tried toggling the auto-mute with no effect.</p>
