<p>It makes sense to reflect on time in week-long chunks instead of day by day. A span of 24 hours is dominated by sleep and childcare, but over the 168 hours of a week, I might have enough discretionary time to feel more balanced.</p>
<p>What makes a week satisfying? How can I prepare so that I can enjoy satisfying weeks more often?</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Enough rest to engage A- with energy and responsiveness</dt>
<dd>Mostly this is about being in tune with myself and understanding my energy levels, so I can make better decisions about staying up late or being on my phone while A- nurses. It&#8217;s also good to not be distracted by other needs or desires, so I can be more present.</dd>
<dt>A couple of walks and baby activities</dt>
<dd>I prefer to stay home when it&#8217;s cold and windy, which is okay. When the weather is mild, we usually go to neighbourhood centres so that A- can play with different toys and be around other people. As the weather warms up and A- grows, we&#8217;ll expand our range.</dd>
<dt>Little stories to share with W-, especially involving close observation</dt>
<dd>Helped by energy and rest. Can encourage this by planning activities as well as following A-&#8216;s interests. This will get even better as A- grows, of course.</dd>
<dt>Contributions to household maintenance</dt>
<dd>Sometimes cooking, if I can pull it off while W- is around. Might be better to focus on cleaning and groceries, though, since those fit better into our current routines.</dd>
<dt>Relaxed conversations with W- during evening playtime with A-</dt>
<dd>Helped by stories and finished chores.</dd>
<dt>An updated journal and weekly review</dt>
<dd>Caught up every couple of days, if needed. Helped by text notes and by doing interesting things.</dd>
<dt>Emacs News posted</dt>
<dd>Monday or Tuesday discretionary time. Pretty straightforward, but I need to spend about 45 minutes of computer time on it.</dd>
<dt>Yummy food, no mealtime scrambling</dt>
<dd>Could use a little work here. We&#8217;ll probably make this smoother as we figure out a new rhythm, especially with batch cooking.</dd>
<dt>A little consulting that helps my clients a lot</dt>
<dd>Helped by having well-defined, useful, tiny chunks. Best done late at night, maybe sleeping in a bit the next day.</dd>
<dt>Thinking through stuff using my phone, not just reading social media updates</dt>
<dd>The payoff for reading social media is mostly chatting with W- about tidbits, occasionally interacting, and sometimes hearing about interesting things. Not that much, so I don&#8217;t have to scroll down the feeds looking for more. Writing is better for me, although I sometimes get stuck if I haven&#8217;t balanced it with some discretionary time for doing things. There&#8217;s always more to write and plan, though.</dd>
<dt>Maybe even a couple of blog posts, a bit of code, or a small improvement</dt>
<dd>Helped by thinking on my phone and by having clear, motivating questions.</dd>
<dt>Stretching</dt>
<dd>Helped by doing the routine together with W-.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Last week was a satisfying week. If I put some thought into it, I might be able to have even more of them. :) Some things are outside my control, but I can probably stack the deck. Hmmâ€¦</p>
