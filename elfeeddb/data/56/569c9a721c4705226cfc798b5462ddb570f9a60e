This is something that has been bugging me for a few years and I can&#039;t find a single image or mention of a bike that matches my memory despite occasional intense interogation of google.<br />
Around the time I was 16&#039;ish (1989-90) one of my older brothers bought a lovely Raleigh racer. It was steel framed and definitely sporty rather than touring biased. I guess he payed around Â£400 for it and the main thing about it was the colour scheme which if I remember correctly was blue around the tube...<br />
