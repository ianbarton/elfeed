<p>Ok, I did all those steps but it doesn&#039;t change anything when NetworkManager has been killed before:<br />- I still get the same dmesg messages that tell me that the firmware is loaded, the device renamed to wlp0s20u1 and finally shows &quot;link is not ready&quot;<br />- I can&#039;t set the device as up. After doing &quot;ip link set wlp0s20u1 up&quot; I still get &quot;state DOWN&quot;:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>10: wlp0s20u1: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether &lt;ethernet-address&gt; brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code></pre></div><p>- An &quot;iw dev wlp0s20u1 scan&quot; still tells me:</p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>command failed: No such device (-19)</code></pre></div>
