<p>Inspired by discussions on the arch-general mailing list, test-sec-flags was created by pid1 (with help from anthraxx, strcat, sangy, and rgacogne) to test the performance impact of various security-oriented compilation and linking flags. The goal is to determine if these flags can be the new default for all Arch Linux packages. Preliminary results suggest that the performance impact is almost nonexistent compare to the compilation flags we already use, but we would like to collect and compare more results before moving forwards.</p>
<p>Download the source <a href="https://github.com/pid1/test-sec-flags">here</a> and see the README for installation and usage instructions.  The results
subdirectory contains instructions on how to pull out the relevant
statistics from the result files.</p>
<p>We are collecting results in the <a href="https://github.com/pid1/test-sec-flags/wiki">test-sec-flags wiki</a> on Github. Please
add your results there. In particular, we would very much like i686
results, as all of the previous contributors have been on x86_64
devices.</p>
<p>Patches welcome.</p>
