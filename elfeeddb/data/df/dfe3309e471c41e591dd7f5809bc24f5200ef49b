Sticks Pass at dusk the previous evening, looking for a tent spot
after a few afternoon pints with an old mate in Keswick. A pre-dawn
start in spookily calm weather, following my torch up onto the high
ground running north from Helvellyn; one point of white LED light
over on the Central Fells, someone else with the same idea. By 08:10
I was on the summit, looking down onto Red Tarn.</p><p>I spent a good few
years living in the Lakes and, latterly, this was the only way I
could enjoy the hills there: late evening or early morning, sometimes
camping overnight then heading down before the crowds had finished
their breakfast. I haven’t actually been back on the Lakes hills
since I left almost 10 years ago, and wasn’t sure how I’d feel about
this short trip.<br/></p>
