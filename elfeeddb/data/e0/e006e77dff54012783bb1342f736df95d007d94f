<p>all syntax coloring on the site are redone, based on the latest version of <a href='xah-elisp-mode.html'>Emacs: Xah Emacs Lisp Mode</a>
(that is, if you use xah-elisp-mode, the coloring in emacs buffer would be the same as on the website.)
</p>

<p>notable is that the coloring are based on the “types” of symbol,
as detailed here: <a href='../misc/elisp_list_function_type_syntax_coloring.html'>Meaning of Lisp List, Function Type, and Syntax Coloring</a></p>

<p>still to do, is the tooltips for variables.</p>
