<p>Hello everyone.</p><p>I recently moved to Arch from Win7 and experience some problems with UI settings. For some reason, UI elements and text in many programs are much bigger than I think they should be: e.g. <a href="http://www.lambda.sx/t3d.png" rel="nofollow">evince</a>, <a href="http://www.lambda.sx/m8L.png" rel="nofollow">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="http://www.lambda.sx/NUf.png" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>.</p><p>I managed to scale text by changing <em>gtk-font-name</em> in <em>/usr/share/gtk-2.0/gtkrc</em>&#160; &#160;and&#160; &#160;<em>/usr/share/gtk-3.0/settings.ini</em> to smaller value. However, it didn&#039;t affected buttons in many programs, which are still too large for my taste. Is there a way to change sizes of such buttons on a system level? I&#039;m pretty sure that I didn&#039;t had this problem with Debian on VM.</p>
