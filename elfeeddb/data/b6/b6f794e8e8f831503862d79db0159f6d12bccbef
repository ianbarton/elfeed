<p>Adam Holt and I were interviewed last night by the <a href="http://acceln.wikispaces.com/" title="ACCE Learning Network">Australian Council for Computers in Education Learning Network</a> about our not-for-profit work to improve educational opportunities for children in the developing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We talked about <a href="http://www.laptop.org">One Laptop per Child</a>, <a href="http://www.laptop.org.au">OLPC Australia</a> and <a href="http://www.sugarlabs.org">Sugar Labs</a>. We discussed the challenges of providing education in the developing world, and how that compares with the developed world.</p>
<p>Australia poses some of its own challenges. As a country that is 90% urbanised, the remaining 10% are scattered across vast distances. The circumstances of these communities often share both developed and developing world characteristics. We developed the <a href="http://www.one-education.org">One Education</a> programme to accommodate this.</p>
<p>These lessons have been developed further into <a href="http://unleashkids.org/">Unleash Kids</a>, an initiative that we are currently working on to support the community of volunteers worldwide and take to the movement to the next level.</p>
