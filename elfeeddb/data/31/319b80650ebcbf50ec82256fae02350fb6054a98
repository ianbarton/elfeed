<p>Two problems: You still are not providing enough information for anyone to help you. V1del told you that in his first reply. You should go to the link he gave you and try to figure out what logs you need to post. The output of </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>journalctl -xb</code></pre></div><p>should contain messages about your printer if it is connected. The CUPS logs may provide some clues. </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>cat /var/log/cups/error_log</code></pre></div><p>The other problem: it seems you ignored V1del&#039;s advice to use gutenprint instead of the Canon driver in the AUR. If both drivers are installed, that may be why you can&#039;t get it to work.</p><p>Did you enable CUPS as instructed in the wiki? My guess is yes because you mentioned that filter error message. I suggest you give the wiki page another read.</p><p>What method did you use to connect to the printer, by command line or by browser? From the CUPS man page:</p><div class="quotebox"><blockquote><div><p>WHERE DO I BEGIN?<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The&#160; easiest&#160; way&#160; to&#160; start is by using the web interface to configure<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;your printer. Go to &quot;http://localhost:631&quot; and choose&#160; the&#160; Administra‐<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;tion&#160; tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the Add Printer button<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;and follow the prompts.</p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login&#160; user‐<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;name and password or the &quot;root&quot; username and password.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>I tried my username &amp; password earlier and it failed. I had to shut down the browser, start over and use the &quot;root&quot; username and password to add a Canon MP190. It works fine with documents, but I can&#039;t print a web page as yet.</p><p>Canon printers, especially newer ones, aren&#039;t the most linux friendly printers. I don&#039;t know how old the MP280 is, but an online review is dated Aug, 2010 which makes me think it&#039;s been around long enough that the gutenprint driver should work.</p><p>You might try deleting the printer in the CUPS browser interface, and then add it again on the Administration page.</p>
