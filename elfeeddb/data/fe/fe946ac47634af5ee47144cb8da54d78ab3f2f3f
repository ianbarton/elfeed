<p>More of a footnote than a review, I thought do a quick mention of Chimpanzee energy snacks.</p>
<p>I picked some samples up at a trade show earlier in the year and they are now all gone. The company is from the Czech Republic and are just coming into the UK now with new distribution. There&#8217;s the usual wide range of energy and protein bars as well as less sugary fuel bars for the weight conscious and bars for kids too.<br />
The good news is that they&#8217;re following the current trend to having these kinds of food actually resemble real food by having textures and taste as well as the fuel hidden within. So they&#8217;re pleasant to eat, taste good and I&#8217;ve had no ill effects to my plumbing. There&#8217;s some left field flavourings too, it&#8217;s nice to see something different.</p>
<p>You could debate the nutritional and fuel aspect of all of these kinds of food into the night and beyond depending on where you stand on such things.<br />
I just like this kind of thing because it&#8217;s handy for a rucksack or a pocket, the good ones are tasty and it keeps hunger away without having to eat big while climbing a hill or putting the miles in down the trail.</p>
