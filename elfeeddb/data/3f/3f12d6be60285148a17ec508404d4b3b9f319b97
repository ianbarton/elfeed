<p>Ah, interesting - I wasn&#039;t even aware that systemd automatically hooks up the std outputs to its journal.</p><p>It turns out that telegram-cli, which I was using for changePicture.zsh, wrote the contents of the picture to stdout or stderr without my knowledge, that&#039;s why it didn&#039;t even occur to me that it could be something as simple as systemd redirecting the out-streams to the log file.<br />Anyway, just redirecting the stdout and stderr streams to /dev/null from telegram-cli was good enough to solve the problem.</p><p>Thanks everyone!</p>
