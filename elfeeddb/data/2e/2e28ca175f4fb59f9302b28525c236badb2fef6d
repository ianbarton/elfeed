<p>That is normal, it&#039;s just your USB receiving/losing a signal and being initialized, the fact that it pops is a hardware &quot;issue&quot; and shouldn&#039;t damage anything. In order to prevent it during a normal session (it will remain on shutdown/poweron) you might want to try and adjust exit-idle-time to a negative value in your /etc/pulse/daemon.conf to prevent pulse from exiting when no client is connected. If that wasn&#039;t already enough disabling/commenting </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>load-module module-suspend-on-idle</code></pre></div><p> in your /etc/pulse/default.pa should prevent pulse from releasing the device and thus keep it open for the remainder of the session. Of course both of these suggestions will sacrifice powersaving features for availability. Remember to restart pulse to make any of your changes to these files have an effect </p><div class="codebox"><pre><code>systemctl --user restart pulseaudio</code></pre></div>
