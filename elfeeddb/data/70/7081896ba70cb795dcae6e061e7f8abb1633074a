Bent the front mudguard on my commuter bike recently so just fitted a new one using the fixings from the old one which had already been bent around to suit the disc brake. <br />
<br />
This was achieved using:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Tool kit</li>
<li>Kitchen as workshop</li>
<li>Mug of tea</li>
<li>Rock and roll on the stereo</li>
<li>Minimum swearing</li>
</ul><br />
