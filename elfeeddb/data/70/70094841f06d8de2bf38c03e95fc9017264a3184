That means lots of dark miles following my own personalised pool of light along tiny rural roads. There was a great sunset last night so I took my camera today. While the sunset wasn’t repeated, I did take this picture while cycling over the M5. I’d been aiming for a balance, getting the sunrise while also catching the streaked lights of the motorists. Unfortunately I over-exposed it, burning out the sky, and didn’t have time to mess about taking multiple shots. Interesting enough technique that I’ll try again in the future.</p>
