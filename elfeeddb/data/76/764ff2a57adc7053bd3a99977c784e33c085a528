I&#039;ve been subscribed to Eurosport for a few years now and usually watch the cycling races/stages on the video section some days after the actual race, in my own time. But just recently there has been a lack of videos available despite the site telling me there are several...like today, says 9 available cycling videos yet only gives me the option of 2 (both short TT&#039;s) <br />
I&#039;ve contacted them to be told.. &#039;not all live events are available on video&#039; ..&#039;try another browser&#039; and &#039;videos may not be...<br />
