<p>Unlike some <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/01/mesa-13-0-3-ubuntu-16-04-lts">online news</a> might’ve let you believe, Mesa 13.0.x is not going to be in 16.04 LTS. And it has only been days since it received the “<a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Ubuntu-16.04.2-LTS-LM-Delay">dated</a>” 12.0.6 release as a SRU together with 16.10.</p>
<p>That said, 13.0.4 is now available on <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/ubuntu/updates">ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/updates</a> for both 16.04 and 16.10. The PPA carries latest LLVM 3.9.1 package as well which fixes some bugs for Radeon users. There were some games released recently that benefit from these, which is one more reason why these backports were (finally) made available.</p>
<p>Update: Ubuntu 17.04 will ship with Mesa 17, so that’s the version which will be backported to 16.04 next.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tjaalton.wordpress.com/230/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/tjaalton.wordpress.com/230/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=tjaalton.wordpress.com&amp;blog=2065367&amp;post=230&amp;subd=tjaalton&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1" width="1" />
