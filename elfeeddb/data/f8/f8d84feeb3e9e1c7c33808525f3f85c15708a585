Hi, I am planning a 7 day tour of Catalonia from Barcelona international airport in September and am looking for a specific tour I can load on to my garmin. We are looking for a varied tour on quiet roads. I have used CTC tours in France/Italy in the past but can&#039;t find anything suitable for Catalonia.  Any help would be much appreciated.
