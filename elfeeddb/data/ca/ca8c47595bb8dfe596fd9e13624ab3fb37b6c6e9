Time to kick off this year&#039;s thread methinks. I&#039;ll flesh it all out over the next week or so but the basic idea will follow what was a pretty successful formula over the past couple of editions. I&#039;m running it a bit later than previous years as my regular slot has already gone to another ride and I don&#039;t want to create a clash. I&#039;m also hoping that maybe mid May weather may be <span style="text-decoration: underline">even</span> better than last year&#039;s<br />

1) 8am start Manchester Piccadilly railway station<br />
2) Coffee/Snack stop...<br />
