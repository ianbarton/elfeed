Im going to be undertaking the London to Paris ride on Thursday 20th July 2017, hopefully in 24 hours. I will be getting the 11pm ferry from newhaven and then most likely the Eurostar back.<br />
<br />
If anyone else would be interested in joining me then drop a message to this chat and I can send across all my details etc!<br />
<br />
Look forward to hearing from you! <img src="/styles/default/xenforo/smilies/tongue.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":tongue:" title="Tongue    :tongue:" />
