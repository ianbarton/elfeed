When the stream goes away, the profile gets restored back to A2DP. This way the user doesn&#039;t have to manually switch the profiles when starting and stopping a call. This behaviour can be disabled by giving argument <strong>auto_switch=false to module-bluetooth-policy</strong>.</p></div></blockquote></div></div></blockquote></div><p>Thanks a lot!
