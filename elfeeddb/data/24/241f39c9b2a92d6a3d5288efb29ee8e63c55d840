Hi guys, back on the bike after a dismal accident in June and wanting to fit in a sportive-sized ride per month next year. So, without further ado, who fancies a January jaunt around the Tay?<br />
<br />
I&#039;m Dundee based but believe Perth was the preferred meetup the last few times. I&#039;d personally do a ride through Fife to meet the group at Perth and then Perth -&gt; Dundee where i&#039;d depart (and let others take you through Fife!).<br />
<br />
Let&#039;s see if we can get something going <img src="/styles/default/xenforo/smilies/smile.gif" class="mceSmilie" alt=":smile:" title="Smile    :smile:" />
