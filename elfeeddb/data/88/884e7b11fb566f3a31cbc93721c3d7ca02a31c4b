<p>Once again, <a href="http://ubucon.org/en/events/ubucon-summit-us/" rel="nofollow">UbuCon Summit</a> will be hosted by the <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x/" rel="nofollow">Southern California Linux Expo</a> in Pasadena, California on March 2nd and 3rd.  UbuCon Summit is two days that celebrate Ubuntu and the community, and this year has some excitement in store.</p>

<p>Thursday's keynote will feature Carl Richell, the CEO and founder of <a href="https://system76.com/" rel="nofollow">System 76</a>, a premium source of Ubuntu desktop and laptop computers.  Entitled "Acrylic, Aluminum, Thumb Screws, and Heavy Machinery at System 76," he will share how System 76 is reinventing what it means to be a computer manufacturer, and talk about how they are changing the relationship between users and their devices.  Don't miss this fascinating peek behind the scenes of a computer manufacturer that focuses on Ubuntu, and keep your ears peeled because they are announcing new products during the keynote!</p>

<p>We also have community member Amber Graner who will share her inspiring advice on how to forge a path to success with her talk "You Don't Need Permission to Contribute to Your Own Destiny," and Elizabeth Joseph who will talk about her 10 years in the Xubuntu community.</p>

<p>Thursday will wrap up with our traditional open Ubuntu Q&amp;A panel where you can ask us your burning questions about Ubuntu, and Friday will see a talk from Michael Hall, "Sponsored by Canonical" where he describes the relationship between Canonical and Ubuntu and how it's changed, and Sergio Schvezov will describe Ubuntu's next-generation packaging format in "From Source to Snaps."  After a short break for lunch and the expo floor, we'll be back for four unconference sessions, where attendees will come together to discuss the Ubuntu topics that matter most to them.</p>

<p>Ubuntu will be at booth 605 during the Southern California Linux Expo's exhibition floor hours from Friday through Sunday.  You'll be able to see the latest version of Ubuntu, see how it works with touchscreens, laptops, phones, and embedded devices, and get questions answered by both community and Canonical volunteers at the booth.</p>

<p>Come for UbuCon, stay for SCALE!  This is a weekend not to be missed!</p>
