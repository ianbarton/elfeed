<p>A- now has a pair of upper teeth to match her bottom teeth. Whee! She&#8217;s been chomping her way through cucumbers and clementines, and has even threatened their use in the defence of chicken drumsticks.</p>
<p>A-&#8216;s sleep has been a bit irregular, with more fussiness and late nights. Probably related to the emergence of her upper teeth, or possibly a reaction to the chocolate cake we&#8217;ve been having as W- prepares for A-&#8216;s first birthday party. Ah well! That&#8217;s all part of life. We&#8217;re adapting quite nicely to life with interruptions.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s home visit focused on cruising, which A- picked up readily. She can now edge her way along the sofa in order to reach something she wants.</p>
<p>Also, all of a sudden, A- can stack rings on a pole. Not in order, but still! Neat. She hadn&#8217;t gotten much practice with it because we were focusing on stacking blocks. Every so often, I took it out and let her help me push the rings down the pole. This week, she started doing it all by herself, using a finger to help her centre the ring on the pole. By golly. Maybe she&#8217;ll be all right even without stereopsis for depth perception.</p>
<p>An impromptu experiment by W- also confirmed that A- can predict that stuff dropped into a tube should come out the other end. Neat!</p>
<p>W- took care of A- long enough for me to cook quinoa-stuffed peppers one night, shake and bake chicken, curry and roast veg another night, and biscotti on the weekend. I enjoyed making lots of food. It was a rare opportunity to cook for two hours in a row.</p>
<p>Also for party prep and general spring cleaning: W- managed to sell the large glass coffee table I&#8217;d bought almost ten years ago for my apartment. One more thing out the door, hooray!</p>
<p>My parents got the go-ahead to send their passports for Canadian visas, yay! The online application process was pretty convenient, actually. Anyway, W- tested a possible sleeping arrangement by bunking in with A- and me in A-&#8216;s room. Not particularly comfortable, though, so we might need to switch things up a bit more. It will be nice to have them over. A- will probably be 18 months old when they visit, which is a great time for vocabulary acquisition and other good things.</p>
<p>In the meantime, life continues as normal. I managed to do a little consulting, updating some code and unearthing some other code I&#8217;d forgotten about. Someday I&#8217;ll be able to take on bigger projects, but at the moment, it&#8217;s good to do whatever I can.</p>
<p>Next week: taking A- to the cardiologist, looking into the Let&#8217;s Get Started program, and letting her explore all sorts of messy things during sensory play day. Whee!</p>
