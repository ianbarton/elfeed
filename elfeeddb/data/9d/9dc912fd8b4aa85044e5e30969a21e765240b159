With snaps and their transactional update capabilities, enterprises can easily deploy new software onto their gateways with the certainty that their device will continue to operate whether the update is successful or not. Enterprises looking to deploy IoT solutions also benefit from the large number of developers and system integrators offering IoT solutions for Ubuntu. </p>
