<p>Wicd also has a service - wicd.service that, like networkmanager should auto-connect after boot.&#160; This is maybe a bit slower to connect than nm, as it normally disrupts my console login rather than connecting prior to login. But it doesn&#039;t scan, unless requested, or repeatedly feel the need to re-authenticate - which may be causing the issue - there is a low power state that nm seems to have somewhere in the config, and I was always getting notifications for power state changes - which I no longer get.</p><p>So maybe nm puts the radio into a low power state when it is not active and then has to bring it back out of that state when you want to do something - your ping may be operating on both these states - hence low/high responses.&#160; Maybe the good thing about the standard kernel bcm driver is that it&#039;s pretty much in debug mode and lets us know what&#039;s going on, so nm playing the fiddle on this device is quite obvious.</p><p> Just a note on my setup - I disabled NetworkManager.service and the NetworkManager WaitOnLine.service (check the name for this service) and then enabled wicd.service, and everything worked fine, and has continued to do so, even after rfkills and radio restarts.&#160; Some people say that dhcpd service also needs to be disabled as wicd has it&#039;s own version and they may conflict.&#160; I haven&#039;t done much ping analysis, but my speedtest-cli results are more than satisfactory now, and my needs are probably not as finite. </p><p>I did the initial setup with wicd-gtk, but think the wicd-cli tools are more straightforward (excluding wicd-curses which freezes) than the nmcli tool, and the monster manual that is confusing as hell.</p><p>I think, like you, that it is the probably the manager that is the issue rather than the driver, but I am not familiar with the ath drivers.</p>
