This coming Saturday 25th , I will be riding from Tranmere , along route 5 to Mickle Trafford , coffee and food at the cafe at the end of the track. <br />
Back doing a slightly different route . <br />
Anybody fancy joining me , I will either be on a 29er or 26er depends who fancies it really. <br />
I live in Tranmere so that&#039;s where I will be starting . Mostly car free ride just the odd few miles here and there.
