I thought I’d change tack from gloom merchant and purveyor of despair and offer a positive take on the mountains of north Wales.In this I thought I’d offer my favourite mountains which as you might guess, tend to be those peaks far from the madding crowd. Having a Wainwright-esque desire to keep the gore-tex hoards out of sight and mind, increasingly I’ve gravitated towards the lesser known peaks where you can often find yourself following a pathless trail across the hillsides, where only the odd bleating sheep or cronking crow break the silence. So...in no particular order.</span><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4s0Nvnt-EoQ/WH9nZgxT0tI/AAAAAAAAFOQ/Eh5vYhk99I0xdkEf5CQYfRob1uHcYr2PACEw/s1600/ruinddaullt.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4s0Nvnt-EoQ/WH9nZgxT0tI/AAAAAAAAFOQ/Eh5vYhk99I0xdkEf5CQYfRob1uHcYr2PACEw/s200/ruinddaullt.JPG" width="200" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">Ruin under Dduallt</span><br /><b>Rhobell Fawr/ Rhobell y big/ Dduallt.</b><br />Three separate peaks of course but geographically and you might say romantically, part of a rugged triumvirate of remote south Snowdonia mountains. Boldly standing in isolation and separation from the neighbouring Arans and Arenigs to which they all look out to. All three can be bagged together as part of a fairly demanding day’s walking. Given that Rhobell y Big and Dduallt in particular are not over endowed with defined paths and instead demand some testing heather, bog and felled forest stumbling. By contrast, Rhobell Fawr is one of the easiest peaks to attain if you approach via Rhydymain. By driving up into the forest you can park opposite the little gritstone like edge of Fridd Craig Fach which is listed in the CC Merionydd guidebook. I discovered it in the 90‘s and put up a VS route on the far edge of the crag with Harold Drasdo. It has since been worked on by mid Wales climbing maestro Terry Taylor who has added several hard routes to the few more modest things of my own on there. <br /><br />Getting back to ascending the mountain. From the forest lay by, its an easy 30/40 minutes walk to the 2400‘ summit. Climbers have the option of bouldering their way to the top, as the flank is peppered with outcrops and boulders. Just don a pair of old comfortable rock boots or approach shoes and wander from rock to rock. Choosing a line as hard or easy as your skills allow. Rhobell Fawr was a favourite mountain of 1930‘s Guardian columnist and walking guide author, Patrick Monkhouse who wrote the classics ‘On foot in north Wales’ and ‘On foot in the Peak’. Just a couple of miles north west of Rhobell Fawr is the diminutive little peak of Rhobell y Big. Despite being only 1600‘. Rhobell y Big is an attractive little mountain with a jagged cock’s comb peak.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"></span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4KpLpfrBx20/WH9uNgKlugI/AAAAAAAAFPE/tj2BnDDRtwoMfbFeNr1oMopZBnhRCJmDACLcB/s1600/migneint%2Bfeb%2B037.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4KpLpfrBx20/WH9uNgKlugI/AAAAAAAAFPE/tj2BnDDRtwoMfbFeNr1oMopZBnhRCJmDACLcB/s200/migneint%2Bfeb%2B037.jpg" width="150" /></a></div><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Its little summit walls and slabs-like its bigger neighbour-offers the climber some sport. To the east, by the same distance,lies Dduallt. A veritable little Armadillo of a mountain. Just 2100 high but studded with outcrops and largely pathless. The only blemish is a pointless stock fence across its spine. Farmers....ever heard the word ‘Hefting’. Or do only Lake District sheep have this instinct? At the base of its eastern face lies the source of the mighty River Dee which emerges amongst the rocks of what appears as a man made structure, as a seeping puddle.<br /><b><br />Yr Arddu</b><br />Another sub 2000‘ gem, the little&nbsp; Moelwynion outlier, Yr Arddu, packs a punch beyond its size. Another peak studded with outcrops, many of which are recognized climbing venues included in the current Tremadog guidebook, Yr Arddu although lacking in soaring grandeur or even an obvious peak-its long heathery whale back offers a couple of high points, neither of which stand out-the whole massif is nevertheless a complex jigsaw of rock, defiles, tarns and rough ground. One lake in particular offers itself a fabulous wild camping spot. Despite its scale, the outlook in every direction is stunning. Particularly looking south west to the sea.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-60YYdnIlfAs/WH9pNJT4h2I/AAAAAAAAFOk/lK1IApYGnOcrlfD4WARQxZk2AG7isRgUACEw/s1600/manod%2B032.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-60YYdnIlfAs/WH9pNJT4h2I/AAAAAAAAFOk/lK1IApYGnOcrlfD4WARQxZk2AG7isRgUACEw/s400/manod%2B032.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">A slightly surreal little mountain-Manod Mawr.</span><br /><br /><b>Graig Goch and Manod Mawr.</b><br />Graig Goch is not so much a mountain more a winding escarpment which stands out on the edge of the Migneint. The start of the ridge is easily gained by parking just off the B4407 and bog trotting to the start. Despite this, its rare to ever see anyone up here and a clearly defined path follows a serpentine line just above the cliffs to eventually reach another forgotten climbing crag, Carreg y Fran which was briefly popular in the 70‘s and had a few bold routes put up in the early part of this century before retreating back into obscurity. Beyond the rock of the crow lies 2200' Manod Mawr. Another mainly pathless peak easily approached via the quarry road where you can park opposite Carreg y Fran-thereby gaining a lot of ascent- and wander across the cropped flanks between boulders and streams to find yourself looking down on the delights of downtown Blaenau Ffestiniog! Its surreal to be sure, this speckled lump of a mountain with a working quarry blasting out slate on its shoulder, the tumbling grey terraces of Blaenau to the north and to the east, the empty rippling moorland of the Migneint. Its unique vibe further reinforced by the knowledge that under your feet during WW2, the crown jewels and contents of our national galleries and museums were stored for safe keeping in the bowels of the mountain until the war had ended.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pg72gE0fZC0/WH9rVln447I/AAAAAAAAFOw/OJjG_UVr0cI_2dx0Tq3L2FfPVYXT_ZOJACLcB/s1600/migneint%2B029.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pg72gE0fZC0/WH9rVln447I/AAAAAAAAFOw/OJjG_UVr0cI_2dx0Tq3L2FfPVYXT_ZOJACLcB/s400/migneint%2B029.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">Look west to Arenig Fach</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /><b>Arenig Fach</b><br />Much as I love neighbouring Arenig Fawr where I have walked, climbed upon and written about. Detailing the mountain’s unique art and climbing history, little Arenig Fach by comparison is something of a Cinderella...or should it be ugly sister? Incidentally, I’ve never understood why Arenig Fach ever became Arenig Fach (Little Arenig) when that title really should go to Moel Llyfnant which is joined to Arenig Fawr. Arenig Fach by contrast is totally separate and isolated from great Arenig??? Anyway, that being bye the bye, Arenig Fach is nevertheless another mountain within the rough bounds of the Migneint. Just over 2000‘ high, the approach from any direction involves some serious heather bashing and bog trotting as the hoards have yet to beat out a clearly defined path. I always approach after parking next to a little copse just off the A 4391 and following my nose through some pretty unforgiving terrain until I crest a saddle and look down upon remote Llyn Arenig Fach. A veritable wild swimmers delight in summer. This deep lake is fringed under cliffs by rocks which make perfect diving platforms. As an hors d'oeuvre before the main course or as a post peak dessert on your way back, its certainly one of the best wild swimming lakes in north Wales. The mountain’s rather gloomy north eastern face is nevertheless dramatic. A sweep of broken cliffs which have been climbed on but which as yet, have not seen those climbs recorded. The summit itself is rather pleasant with the heathery approach surrendering to a flat rocky pavement and summit cairn which offers wonderful views all around.</span><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M4p2ougZ4W0/WH9pqq-LA4I/AAAAAAAAFOs/oHpKgKSwzDgPzS1CTjINXMH0UPAmNyocgCEw/s1600/dec28%2B036.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-M4p2ougZ4W0/WH9pqq-LA4I/AAAAAAAAFOs/oHpKgKSwzDgPzS1CTjINXMH0UPAmNyocgCEw/s320/dec28%2B036.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-family: &quot;courier new&quot; , &quot;courier&quot; , monospace;">Llyn Arenig Fach.
