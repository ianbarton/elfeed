It's also the number you should dial if you get into real trouble in New Zeeland. Apart from those things, one hundred and eleven is the number of posts that have appeared in this raggle-taggle blog since I set those first nervous postings loose on the World Wild Web back in March of 2009. Not being one for Birthday celebrations I let the one and two year milestones slip by unnoticed. My century also went by without either song or dance. A Nelson however, just has to be acknowledged!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Way back then I promised a mix of Gear and&nbsp;MYOG with a few trips thrown in for good measure. But, as this place has developed it's taken on a different shape; it's become, very much, about the trips.&nbsp;There's been much consternation in blogland of late. In particular with respect to gear&nbsp;reviews there's been a call for a raising of standards, greater professionalism and transparency. There have also been, astonishingly, accusations of dishonesty. I'm confused by this. The blogs I follow I follow because things done and said inspire me, because things done and said touch me, because things done and said challenge me to look at my world, mostly the outdoors world,&nbsp;in a different way&nbsp;and because I feel and affinity with the person behind the words; friends, of sorts, in this strange virtual world.. This medium, I think, lets the person shine through in a way that other's don't. It's the rough edged, (mostly) non-commercial, untouched by the the hand of editor or reviewer, warts n' all format that makes it what it is and that should be applauded. The medium, free of editorial bias, is surely the most transparent there is? I am, as are I suspect most others, perfectly capable of&nbsp; deciding what to take on board. <br /><br />The fact that I personally don't post much on gear isn't born out of some deep seated ethical standpoint but rather out of practicality; I don't get enough time on the hill to review gear properly. Simply put, by the time I've formulated an opinion worth sharing I'm normally too late to join the party. Others do it better than me and should certainly continue to do so.<br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So what does the future hold for this place?&nbsp;Well, there'll certainly be some gear posts but those will mainly be reflections on gear in the context of specific trips and the conditions they served up. Such insights have some value I think. The main focus will continue to be the trips. Writing about my experience in and love of the outdoors is what I get the most pleasure from. It's a way of squeezing the last drizzle of sweet sap out of my too few days outdoors. About creating a place to come back to and relive experiences. About creating a window which, when I'm old and grey, I'll be able to press my nose up against and look&nbsp;on a previous self and the things he does. Sound selfish? Yes it is. It's all about me. Anybody who wants to come along for the ride is, however, very welcome.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There'll be no changes then? Well I do intend to explore something new. My love of the outdoors has always been paralleled by a love of photography.&nbsp;The medium punches much heavier than its weight. Photographs are far more than the sum of their parts. Though made from light alone they&nbsp;somehow capture a heady mix of emotion, smells, sounds, pleasure and discomfort, and solitude and companionship. They convey a message even more effectively that the written word. I revisit my photo's often and intend to mine that seam here. Expect, between&nbsp;trips,&nbsp;more but shorter posts&nbsp;focussed on a single image. More personal feelings and emotional drivel but thankfully shorter end most likely easier to read.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A Nelson! Who'd have though it? I'll now be standing on one leg until 112 appears.</div>
