<p>Sometimes I try to get things done while W- plays with A-. I feel good about taking care of household chores or urgent and important tasks, but I feel weird about discretionary things like updating my journal or working on my computer. Even if I just hang out while they play in the same room, that feels more comfortable than taking advantage of the opportunity for focused time. I wonder why that&#8217;s the case, and if I need to tweak my perspective.</p>
<p>My priorities tend to go like this: if W- wants to spend time with A-, I&#8217;ll take care of household chores like cooking and cleaning. When that&#8217;s done, we&#8217;ll play together, unless there&#8217;s a big and important task taking up brainspace. If so, I&#8217;ll try to get that done before returning to play.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s useful to have some shared play time. I pick up ideas from the way W- and A- interact, and it&#8217;s a good time for us to reconnect. Sometimes we come up with new games when we&#8217;re all together. A- also sees us interact with each other, which is good.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also useful for W- to have some one-on-one time with A-, and for me to have some discretionary time. I&#8217;d feel more comfortable about taking that discretionary time if I had a clear purpose for it, like an hour or two of consulting, or some business paperwork &#8211; especially things where I need to be focused and awake. If it&#8217;s something I can do just as well when A-&#8216;s asleep, even with the interruptions, I often prefer to postpone it until then.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t a lot of tasks that I feel I need to do right away. Most things can be done when the opportunity arises, whether that&#8217;s when A- finally sleeps soundly enough for me to unlatch her and leave, or when she eventually goes to school. On the other hand, there&#8217;s a definite time bound on this shared playtime with W-, and even for solo playtime with A-. There are only so many hours I&#8217;ll get to enjoy like this. I think that might be one of the reasons why I prioritize spending time with them.</p>
<p>How can I make even better use of shared time with W- and A-? I want A- to focus on W-, so I support their play instead of competing for attention. Cameras distract her attention and disrupt the flow, so I&#8217;ll just have to settle for observing so that I can draw and tell stories later.</p>
<p>A- will eventually become more independent, especially when she reduces her nursing frequency. Then she and W- can establish father-daughter bonding time and their own rituals &#8211; maybe at least two hours a week, based on the guidelines I came across. I can save my daytime discretionary tasks for then. We&#8217;ll also have some shared family time, and a few chunks of discretionary time for W- so that he can explore hobbies such as woodworking.</p>
<p>This time is short, and it passes quickly. I&#8217;ve had plenty of practice examining that little urge to Get Things Done and deciding whether it actually makes sense. For now, I&#8217;ve got this rare opportunity to prioritize play.</p>
