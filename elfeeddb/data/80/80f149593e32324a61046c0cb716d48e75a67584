Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
My flatmate and I are in the market for some touring bikes, but as students everything seems to be a bit out of range price wise.<br />
<br />
We have been looking at the Roux Etape 150 and the Adventure Flat White, but I feel that I could be better placed getting something second hand? <br />
<br />
The new Raleigh Royal looks like a great touring machine, but again out of our price range - is there anything to be said for the multiple &#039;old&#039; raleigh royals that are to be found when scouring ebay? Or...<br />
<br />
