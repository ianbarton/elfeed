<p> <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io">Mike Zamansky</a> has video number 30 up in his <i>Learning Emacs</i> series. It’s the <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/posts/using-emacs-30-elfeed-2/#.WLMf4BiZOuU">second video in his series about Elfeed</a>, an RSS reader for Emacs. </p>
<p> Zamansky says that he generally likes Elfeed but that it’s inconvenient to jump to a category of feeds. For example, if you want to see all the entries tagged “Emacs” you have to type in a longish search string. Zamansky solved this with a hydra. He types one key to bring up the hydra and then another to choose the category he wants to see. That works well and makes navigating your feed almost frictionless. </p>
<p> If you’d like to try Elfeed, you’ll want something like Zamansky’s solution to speed things up. The video is a little over 11 minutes so it should fit well in a coffee break. </p>
