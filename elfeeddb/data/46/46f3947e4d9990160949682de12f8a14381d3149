Batch, the highest point of the Mendips. After a couple of horrendous
clean-up jobs following misconceived muddy outings, I had a tantrum a
few weeks back and resolved not to go mountain biking locally until I
got a hard frost. The last ride in particular had been a shocker, mud
forced round the seatstays and shock stanchions like toothpaste
out of a tube, building up to the extent I couldn’t keep the wheels
turning. No more…</p><p>…until this morning.
Out of the door at 07:00, winching myself up onto the tops for
sunrise, then a couple of hours of rock solid trails. I arrived back
home with a bike so clean I won’t have to do anything other than wipe a
patina of dust off the stanchions. Now THAT is the kind of mountain
biking I like…!</p>
