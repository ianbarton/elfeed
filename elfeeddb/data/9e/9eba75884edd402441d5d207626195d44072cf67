<p>Hello! So I&#039;m having an issue where after I suspend to RAM and then wake up, Arch will work as normal for a few seconds and then freeze. I can move the mouse, but it won&#039;t respond to any clicks, or keyboard input, or anything at all. At that point I&#039;m forced to just shutting down by holding the power button. I tried and this happens when I suspend to ram via the GUI option in KDE, via the konsole, and by just closing the lid on my laptop.</p><br /><p> I&#039;ve looked around and found threads on this forum that mention this problem, and all the ones I&#039;ve found said that they fixed this problem by updating to the latest kernel (Which in the threads I&#039;ve found were all 3.XX so those were rather old). I can&#039;t find any recent threads that mention this issue, so I&#039;m hoping someone else knows whats going on and can help me out.</p>
